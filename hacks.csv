Converting a book into a short Tik Tok style videos

## **The Hack**

This week at Sundai Club, we' built a tool that turns books into ultra-short videos. We started with the idea of 5-minute summaries but quickly pivoted to TikTok-length clips. Our goal is simple: help people revisit key points from books they've already read. We built our MVP using content from ""The 4-Hour Workweek"" by Tim Ferriss. To test versatility, we also created demos using a recent Presidential Debate transcript.¬†Check out a¬†[**sample video**](https://sundai.club/images/documentation/week_25/output.mp4)¬†to see the one-day beta results!

## **How it Works**

#TheDigest takes a book in epub format and converts it into short videos. The current version, which takes in text is live at¬†[**https://digest.sundai.club/**](https://digest.sundai.club/)

Pipeline overview:

1. Chunk the epub into chapters
2. Write a Script using Claude3
3. Break the script into sub-sections with GPT-4
4. Create a prompt for each sub-section
5. Generate relevant video for the background using Runway's Stable-diffusion inpainting model to create an infinite loop .mp4
6. Generate audio from the script, combine with video (because the video is an infinite loop, it can be repeated to match the length of the audio)
7. Add captions to video
8. Export & show to the user!

It made sense to split into two teams: One focused in building the Script and other one building the Video.

**Script Team**

Our process boiled down to four key steps: generalizing the chunking,¬†[converting chunks into scripts](https://github.com/sundai-club/book-digest/blob/main/video_helpers/to_script.py), generating metadata, and¬†[selecting video content](https://github.com/sundai-club/book-digest/blob/main/video_helpers/prompt_to_stock_video.py).

The core challenge was breaking books into digestible pieces that could be turned into engaging videos. We tackled this by using EPUB files and extracting HTML elements. We split the text into headers, each representing a paragraph long enough for one video. This was exposed through an API that could list all chapters in a book.

With chunks in hand, we turned to prompt engineering. We fed each chunk to Claude 3, our chosen LLM, to generate engaging scripts for TikTok-style videos. We also extracted metadata like descriptions, tags, and titles.

For visuals, we experimented with selecting royalty-free video content to match our scripts. While we explored video selection and metadata generation, our main focus remained on extracting meaningful chunks and turning them into compelling scripts.

This streamlined approach allowed us to efficiently transform book content into short, engaging video scripts, ready for audio and visual enhancement.

**Video Team**

The second team focused on four main steps: converting text to audio, designing the UI, creating the pipeline, and generating scripts with prompts.

We took the scripts from the first team and transformed them into the final video product. Here's how we did it:

1. Audio conversion: We used OpenAI to convert summarized book text into MP3 files with timestamps. This involved two API calls - one for MP3 creation and another for timestamp generation.
2. UI development: We built the interface using TypeScript, tRPC, Prisma, and Next.js, all powered by¬†[Codapt](https://codapt.ai/)¬†(shoutout to the founder who joined us for the hack today - it's worth checking out).
3. Video processing: We broke down the scripts into subsections, each corresponding to a video snippet. Using Stable Diffusion Inpainting, we generated visuals for each subsection.
4. Prompt engineering: GPT-4 helped us turn scripts into subsections and generate prompts for visual creation.
5. Final assembly: We overlaid text on the videos and integrated all components into a cohesive pipeline.

The result? A fully functional product where all parts communicated seamlessly. We successfully bridged the gap between text scripts and engaging, ready-to-share video content.

052b9810-3b05-4780-9ad2-31589624ba1b,Long Context SFT Chunking,We study techniques to save GPU memory when fine-tuning LLMs on long completions such as reasoning.,"Fine-tuning LLMs on long completions became a popular problem due to growing interest in reasoning models like DeepSeek R1. In order to teach smaller LLMs (8B or even 1.5B) to reason it is best to first fine-tune them on reasoning traces of larger models. The challenge is that reasoning traces are very long and can easily exceed 20k tokens. Vanilla SFT (with, e.g., transformers library) on such long completions results in OOM even for small models. Thus researchers often truncate the completions leading to reduced performance.

To understand how to improve GPU memory efficiency we tried several methods:

1. Vanilla fine-tuning
2. Chunking completions into sequences of ~2k consecutive tokens and computing the total loss cumulatively. We used Pytorch GPU memory profiling and torch.cuda.memory_allocated to measure the effectiveness. While helpful we noticed that memory growth as we go through chunks. This led to the next idea.
3. Gradient accumulation over the sequence length. Here we added .backward(retain_graph=True) after computing loss on every chunk (except last) which gave major memory savings at the cost of FLOPs.
4. Chunking vocabulary into smaller groups of tokens. We do that to avoid the computation of a large tensor with all logits used to compute the batch training loss; instead, we chunk the ~150k tokens into smaller subsets with 10k different tokens and perform computations in those groups. Our code is inspired by the idea described in the `_cross_entropy_forward` function by [Unsloth](https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth/blob/main/unsloth/kernels/cross_entropy_loss.py)!

Baseline GPU memory and run-time (idea 1):

Although memory savings are impressive, time per iteration increased. However, it is likely that a more careful implementation can mitigate the increased run-time:
![Screenshot 2025-04-13 at 9.05.00‚ÄØPM.png](https://storage.googleapis.com/club-site-images/projects/6163c71d-4238-4d60-b864-c24588555a7c-Screenshot_2025-04-13_at_9.05.00_PM.png)

For the vocabulary chunking idea, we compare against the idea in 2 (chunking completions into sequences of ~2k tokens) and present the following results. In the next two figures, we show that we are able to reduce the maximum use of GPU memory even further if the smaller subsets of unique tokens using the vocabulary chunking idea is small enough. First figure corresponds to idea 2 and the second to idea 4.

The core idea is to translate user queries into Russian before sending them to DeepSeek, as the model applies stricter censorship to English inputs but is more lenient with Russian text. The process works as follows:

1. Input Processing (English ‚Üí Russian)
A user enters a query in English.
The query is sent to OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-based translation model, which converts it into Russian.

2. Query Execution (DeepSeek in Russian)
The translated Russian text is passed into DeepSeek-R1.
DeepSeek generates a response in Russian. Unlike English inputs, Russian queries receive less censorship, allowing for more complete answers.

3. Output Processing (Russian ‚Üí English)
The Russian response from DeepSeek is fed back into OpenAI‚Äôs translation model.
The model translates it back into English.

4. Returning the Final Answer
The fully processed and uncensored response is displayed to the user in English.

This method effectively sidesteps DeepSeek‚Äôs content moderation filters, as its Russian-language responses are significantly less restricted. While some ideological bias still remains, this approach allows OpenSeek to provide users with more open and transparent AI-generated answers, free from the heavy-handed censorship found in the original model.

Are there tasks that you know you need to do but dread having to do them? Applying for jobs, shopping for groceries, paying your bills, travel arrangements, booking appointments, organizing your digital photos, etc.

What if AI could take over some of those tasks, and do them on your behalf? That's where AutoTask comes in - it watches what you're doing throughout the day, and sees which tasks you're repeatedly doing, and comes up with a plan for automating those tasks.

These tasks come into the AutoTask dashboard where you can review the plan before accepting the task. Once you accept the task, AutoTask gets to work - firing up a browser and executing the plan to complete the task. When it's done with the task, it reports back what it did in the dashboard.

# Tech used

AutoTask is comprised of 3 key components:

- [Screenpipe](https://screenpi.pe) for capturing screen activity and OCRing it (it can also record audio and transcribe it). We've built a custom pipe called `tasks-auto-complete` that captures the OCR output from Screenpipe, passes it to OpenAI which then returns suggestions on how to automate the activity.

- the [Electron app](https://github.com/sundai-club/tasks-auto-complete/blob/main/electron-app/main.js) then listens for tasks suggested by the `tasks-auto-complete` pipe and displays them in the dashboard. It's the ""glue code"" that takes the tasks from the pipe and passes them along to browser use for execution. It also has a MacOS notification capability to alert you when it's identified a task to be automated.

- [Browser Use](https://browser-use) for using AI to execute tasks in the browser. Browser use has a whole [library of tasks](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use/tree/main/examples) that it can automate including [grocery shopping](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use/blob/main/examples/use-cases/shopping.py)!

# Future improvements

1. As the name would suggest, Browser Use only does tasks in the browser, but the same company has built an alpha version of [macOS use](https://github.com/browser-use/macos-use) for doing tasks on your Mac, but we didn't use it for AutoTask because it was too unstable to use with 3rd party MacOSX apps (Apple native apps worked well though). Once this gets more mature, we'd like to extend AutoDesk to do any task on your computer, not just things that must be done in the browser.

2. In the settings screen of the Electron app, we could store commonly used bits of information that could then be passed to Browser Use for filling out forms (name, email, phone, zipcode, etc.) and on the dashboard, there could be buttons for triggering common tasks (not necessarily ones that it's seen you do before).

3. Screenpipe also has the capability to record the microphone and audio so any Zoom conversations you're having or voice journaling that you have while working at your computer, could be captured and also used for suggesting tasks to automate.
 
4. When it suggests a plan, it would be nice to be able to see all of the steps, and reorder them, delete them, add new steps, and inject ""human-in-the-loop"" steps before it's about to make a purchase or do something that you want to approve before executing.

5. Since all of the OCR and audio transcriptions are stored in a SQLite database, the Electron app could query that database to look at past trends (by date range, application name, or keywords) to surface things that you'd like the AI to suggest automating. This post-processing analysis might also be more performant than the real-time pipe method we're using now.

## **End vision**

When hosting a watch party, everyone can control the effects on a movie with the Sundai Chrome Extension. With one click, filters and fun effects are added and chaos ensues!

## **How does Sundai Watch Soiree work?**

The extension is build with 3 main components:

1. **Popup**¬†- all the logic of the menu that allows users to select filters and setup the extension
2. **Background script**¬†a script running in the background independent from the popup and particular tabs. Here we are importing the libraries, establishing a connection between the popup and the tabs, and saving the settings to the local storage if needed.
3. **Content script**¬†- the part of the code that is executed separately for each tab and is what actually applies the filter logic. The content scripts listen to messages from the background and apply the filters accordingly.

In order to detect faces we are using Mediapipe from Google¬†https://developers.google.com/mediapipe.

In our party mode we are using¬†¬†https://socket.io/¬†to establish communication with the control page.

We wanted to solve a real problem: AI inference is expensive. Our solution? Batch requests together and run on cheaper hardware. Simple, but effective (and turns out not simple in practice).

## What We Built

A logo generator that lets users create custom logos using AI. But here's the twist - instead of processing each request immediately, we batch them together and run them in groups. The result? Up to 90% cost savings so you get 1000 images for extremely cheap.

The trade-off is that users have to wait a bit longer for their results. But we figured saving that much money might make people patient.

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: NextJS + React with shadcn components
- Backend: Convex.dev for the webapp, flask on the GPUs
- Database/Backend: convex.dev for real-time updates
- AI: Hugging Face transformers + Stable Diffusion (the big one)
- Infrastructure: vast.ai for that sweet, cheap compute

## The Sprint to the Finish

Classic hackathon story - everything was broken until literally the last minute. We're talking 8:59 PM, one minute before demos, and we're still pushing fixes. But hey, we got it working when it counted.

## What We Learned

1. Batch processing can dramatically cut inference costs. We did it.
2. Users might actually be cool with waiting if it means paying way less

## What's Next

fe239509-56c0-4778-9c6e-15cff41850e7,Limitations of RL,Does RL unlock new capabilities? We extend a recent study for Countdown and K&K.,"# Limitations of RL

Recent breakthroughs in reasoning-focused large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI-o1, DeepSeek-R1, and Kimi-1.5 have largely relied on Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). Recent work ([Limit of RLVR](https://limit-of-rlvr.github.io/)) highlights a surprising limitation of reinforcement learning (RL): RL only improves the sampling efficiency (pass@1) and does not outperform pass@k (for large k), thus it does not unlock new capabilities in LLMs. We extend their results by conducting pass@k evaluation on Countdown and K&K puzzles utilized in recent RL works.


## Countdown

We used [Countdown dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Jiayi-Pan/Countdown-Tasks-3to4) which have a target number and set of numbers which can be used to form the target using basic arthimetic operations (+, -, /, *). 

**Example**

***Using the numbers [44, 19, 35], create an equation that equals 98. You can use basic arithmetic operations (+, -, \*, /) and each number can only be used once.***

**Answer:** 44+19+35=98.

## Experiments
1. We evaluate the capabilities of various Qwen LLMs. 
2. On the test set, we evaluated the models for pass@256 samples. For each example we sampled 256 responses from the LLM and evaluated if one of these responses were correct at different intervals.
3. We evaluated 5 different models from the Qwen2.5 family - 0.5B (base), 1.5B (base), 1.5B-Instruct, 3B (base), and 3B-Instruct.


## Results
![Screenshot 2025-04-27 at 8.37.28‚ÄØPM](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H1n06r3yge.png)

Findings:
- We confirm that 0.5B model is not capable of solving countdown. RL does not help as reported by TinyZero.
- Interestingly, instruct models outperform base models. TinyZero reported that performance was similar in their experiments.
- Pass@256 for 1.5B and 3B models outperforms RL in some cases, identifying further inefficiencies of existing RL algorithms.
- See [TinyZero X post](https://x.com/jiayi_pirate/status/1882839370505621655) for RL performance numbers.


## Knights & Knaves

This puzzle was studied in [Logic-RL: Unleashing LLM Reasoning with
Rule-Based Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.14768).

![Screenshot 2025-04-27 at 8.10.22‚ÄØPM](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r1AdDB2Jlg.png)

Here are our pass@k evaluations:

![Screenshot 2025-04-27 at 8.16.30‚ÄØPM](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Hy0JFB31gl.png)

The paper reports quite impressive results for 8 people difficulty, although we can't conclude that RL led to new capabilities since we ran our evaluation with a much smaller 1.5B model.


## Conclusion
By comparing our results to prior works experimenting with RL, we see that current RL methods have an upper bound approximately matching pass@k performance for a large k. How can we unlock new capabilities using RL? Qwen 2.5 0.5B tackling Countdown might be a useful testbed for new ideas.

## Next Steps

Current RL training recipe does not necessarily make the model learn new information, it simply optimizes the sampling paths. We think distillation could be a good way to improve the model performance on certain tasks and break the RL upper bound.

We conducted an initial experiment, fine-tuning Qwen 2.5 1.5B Instruct on ~6.5k countdown samples generated by Qwen 2.5 32B Instruct and verified with oracle verifier for correctness. Performance of the 1.5B model went up from 4% to 46%. TinyZero achieved 55% with RL using ~330k samples. Likely with more samples distillation can match RL, but we ran out of time :cry:",Mikhail Yurochkin,True,3.0,"<a href=""https://sundai.club/projects/fe239509-56c0-4778-9c6e-15cff41850e7"" style=""color: black; text-decoration: none; target=""_blank"">Limitations of RL</a>",Limitations of RL: Does RL unlock new capabilities?

3a8da02e-cf13-4d02-a2de-0028f0ec6ec6,Searching the brain of LLMs,We explore LLM pre-training data and map to LLM abilities,"# Creating a Heuristic to Detect LLM failiure

## Motivation
One problem with using LLMs, or Large Language Models, for research or as a search engine is their tendency to hallucinate or not know answers. This is because their knowledge of facts is often limited by their training data. Because of this problem, we set out to find a metric that can be used to detect if an LLM is likely to fail.

## Solution
We hypothesized that the output quality of the model when given a query would depend on the occurrence of the subject of the query in the training data. Ultimately, we wanted to test the correlation between the LLM being correct and the number of occurrences of the subject in the training data.

## Methods
### Getting a List of Instances where LLMs failed
We decided to use the [SimpleQA](https://openai.com/index/introducing-simpleqa/) test set from OpenAI to identify LLM failure as it contains many instances where a LLM would get the wrong answer. This dataset consists of simple trivia questions like:
> Question: Who received the IEEE Frank Rosenblatt Award in 2010?	
> Answer: Michio Sugeno


### Getting the occurances of the Query Subject inside the Training Data
To solve this problem, we used existing software, Infini-gram, which is used to navigate open-source datasets for LLMs. We used the OLMo 2 32B Instruct dataset for our investigation. Infini-gram has a [web interface](https://huggingface.co/spaces/liujch1998/infini-gram) as well as an API. We used this to get the counts from a subject for example.
![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r1m9QQ-fge.png)
The one problem with this is that when there are too many words in the query, Infini-gram does not find anything, even when the answer is in the corpus. Because of this, it was necessary to condense the query into a small set of words that contained information on the question and answer from the dataset that would be asked to the LLM.
### First Attempt
We vibe-coded a query generator using Spacy en_core_web_trf NER (named entity recognition) model. The idea is to extract named entities from the question and combine them with last-name or last word from the answer using AND. Then each query is ran against the OLMo 2 32B Instruct dataset. Below is an example:
![Screenshot 2025-05-25 at 7.46.43‚ÄØPM](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1Vg3X-fxe.png)
Final score is computed by multiplying the query counts by query length (longer queries are more precise and should be upweighted) and clipping it at 1000 (if the data has ~1000 documents with a given query it should be enough for an LLM to learn it), then averaging scores for all queries corresponding to a question. Below are the results:
![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1rz9QWzge.png)

We see that for questions that the model (GPT4o) answers correctly, the score is consistently high. However, for the incorrect questions the variance is very large. This is due to the limitations of the query generator which sometimes produces misleading queries:
![Screenshot 2025-05-25 at 7.44.56‚ÄØPM](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rk4Kj7Zfel.png)


### Condensing the Query Approach 2.
The goal with condensing the query was to get a small string of words that contain information on the question and the answer. 
>Query: What's the name of the women's liberal arts college in Cambridge, Massachusetts? Radcliffe College
>Answer: Cambridge AND Radcliffe College
**Note the AND means that Cambridge and Radcliffe College do not have to appear consecutively but just in the same document.*

The first thing we needed to do was strip the query of context‚Äîwords like ""what's"" or ""the"". The only important information is the proper nouns, such as ""Cambridge, Massachusetts"" and ""Radcliffe College."" While this was rather short, there were other queries that had more proper nouns which were not as useful. One way we dealt with this problem was to pick the proper noun in the query that appeared the least in the corpus. This way, if this proper noun intersected with the answer, there was probably a relationship inside the training data.
Example:


![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1WmNVbMgg.png)


Since the occurrences of ""Cambridge"" in the corpus are a lot lower than the occurrences of ""Massachusetts"" the question would just be shortened to Cambridge. 
Using this system the final query would be:

Cambridge AND Radcliffe College
and this results in a count of 24142
 occurrences in the training data.

## Results 2nd Attempt
The results for the second attempt were promising. We ran our algorithm on 30 question-and-answer pairs to predict whether an LLM would likely produce misinformation. For the example LLM, we chose to use GPT-4o, and we quizzed it on 30 question-and-answer pairs from our dataset, noting whether it got the answers correct or not. After this, we ran our algorithm to check the number of occurrences of the question subject + answer in the training data. If there were fewer than 150 occurrences in the training data, it was highly unlikely the LLM would get it right and would likely hallucinate, so we used this to classify hallucinations.

![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1IZ4NZMlx.png)

From running this experiment, we found that the algorithm correctly predicted whether an LLM would get the answer right or wrong 90% of the time. The confusion matrix below represents the results.

This test was run on only 30 question-and-answer pairs and would need to be run on more to determine if this is a good metric to be used in the future. However, it has shown promise in recognizing hallucinations, as it has no false positives.

## Third Attempt
We looked the first 100 questions in the simpleQA data whose answers are people's names. For each question, we used OpenAI o3-mini to prepare a command for infini-gram queries. For example, for the question ""Who received the IEEE Frank Rosenblatt Award in 2010?"", o3-mini generates the query command ""Michio Sugeno AND Frank Rosenblatt Award"". We then use these commands to search over the RedPajama database. We then ask o3-mini to answer each question, and compare the correctness with the query count. Here is the plot:
![o3mini_vs_RedPajama](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ByCtXE-Glg.png)

We tried the same for 4o and this is the result:
![4o_vs_RedPajama](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HkDNIEZMll.png)

We observed that these questions are hard for large models, especially for reasoning models. o3-mini only has 10% success rates, while 4o has 20% success rate. The success cases in 4o are correlated with the appearance of the knowledge in the database.



## Another Application: O\*NET Tasks Representativeness

Our previous experiments demonstrate relation between LLM abilities and pre-training data. Here we apply this intuition to study which real-world tasks are better represented in the pre-training data, hence easier for LLMs.

Inspired by the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.10130) ‚ÄúGPTs are GPTs‚Äù, we set out to explore frameworks to analyze the impact of LLMs on the economy & future of the labor market using [O*NET‚Äôs datasets](https://www.onetcenter.org/database.html#individual-files) containing occupation-specific task descriptors.

O\*NET is a U.S. Department of Labor database that classifies occupations and details the key tasks associated with each role. These task descriptions capture core job activities and help support workforce research, training, and development by providing structured, standardized information across professions. Our objective in this section is to describe a method that could be potentially used to understand which task (or occupations) could be done with a higher quality by an LLM. 

We consider only tasks that could be done using text-only LLM outputs and consider that an LLM is probably good at the given task if it is well represented in the pretraining data; we select 20 tasks from different occupations and design several task-specific queries and check how well they are represented in the data. We try two different ways of generating queries.

![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJnAkVZGex.png)

### 1st Approach

In this approach, we use an indirect (but realistic) way of generating queries to the pretraining data. As before, we generate n-grams that are going to be used to query count numbers from the pretraining data. In more detail, we follow the steps for each task: 

1. Generate 5 real instances of the task in which the GPT-4.1 will respond to. For example, for ""Mathematicians"", it would generate a math problem and respond to it. Then, based on the response, we ask it to generate a list of n-grams per task; we pick the two most important ones (ordered by the language model). The prompt template used in this step is:

```
    You are a professional career-simulation assistant.
    
    I will give you:
    ‚Ä¢ an O*NET occupation
    ‚Ä¢ a task description for that occupation
    
    Your tasks  
    1. **Instance** ‚Äì Create one realistic, concrete instance of the task that could plausibly occur in day-to-day work. Keep it concise (‚âà1‚Äì2 sentences), vivid, and specific. Do **not** mention O*NET, the variables, or meta-comments.  
    2. **Response** ‚Äì Reply as a competent human carrying out that instance. Show domain knowledge, sound judgment, and natural phrasing (2‚Äì4 sentences).  
    3. **N-grams** ‚Äì Extract a Python list (3‚Äì7 items) of the most relevant n-grams (1- to 4-word sequences) that appear *verbatim* in your **response** and are directly related to performing the task. Exclude generic stop-words or phrases unrelated to the task. Order the n-grams by importance (from the most important to the least).
    
    Output format **(strict)** ‚Äì return a **single-line** Python dictionary containing **exactly** the keys below and nothing else:  
    output = {{'instance': '<instance>', 'response': '<response>', 'ngrams': ['<gram1>', '<gram2>', ...]}}
    
    Requirements  
    ‚Ä¢ Do not include line breaks inside any of the dictionary values or inside the list.  
    ‚Ä¢ Do not wrap the dictionary in markdown or code fences.  
    ‚Ä¢ Do not add extra keys, comments, or explanatory text.
    
    Occupation: {{occup}}  
    Task: {{task_desc}}
```

2. We pool all the n-grams together and query their counts in the pretraining data and take their log.

To compare different tasks/occupations, we plot the boxplot of the log of their (n-gram) counts, which can be been below:


![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ry6RkEbzlx.png)

### 2nd Approach

We prompt Claude Sonnet 4 to generate the queries for each of the occupation-task pairs.

![Screenshot 2025-05-25 at 8.08.00‚ÄØPM](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H1TkZ4ZMxg.png)

Some examples of the generated queries:
![Screenshot 2025-05-25 at 8.07.13‚ÄØPM](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJa2lV-fgx.png)

Results overall seem to make sense but differ from the previous approach suggesting that we need to develop more rigorous approach to obtain reliable findings.

68addf3e-f3ff-4da7-977d-14e0a4d14850,InstaPay,Instant pay for gig workers through Radius testnet,"A minimal service that stores wallet ID and driver IDs, receives updated balances from gig platforms and triggers instant USDC payments to onboarded drivers stored wallet ID via Radius Network.
 
# InstaPay 1-Day MVP: Components to Build

## 1. Driver Registration Endpoint
- POST `/api/register-driver` endpoint receiving new driver opt-ins
- Stores driver ID, bank name, wallet address, and instant pay preferences
- Validates required fields before saving to database

## 2. Driver Database
- Simple JSON store with driver information
- Keys: driver IDs
- Values: wallet addresses, balance history, payment preferences

## 3. Balance Polling System
- Timer that runs every minute
- Queries DoorDash API for earnings updates of registered drivers
- Compares current balances with previously recorded values
- Identifies drivers eligible for instant transfers

## 4. Payment Processor
- Connects to Radius Network SDK
- Initiates USDC transfers for eligible earnings
- Records transaction details and status
- Updates driver balance records after successful transfers

## 5. Status Dashboard (TIME PERMITTING)
- Simple HTML page showing:
  - Registered drivers and their preferences
  - Recent transactions with status
  - Current InstaPay wallet balance on Radius

These components work together to create a complete flow from driver registration to payment execution, with the balance polling system replacing the webhook approach for the MVP. 

## 


# DEMO 

* Today we're demonstrating our InstaPay system that enables instant payments for gig workers using USDC on the Radius Network. Instead of waiting days for payment, drivers can get paid immediately after completing deliveries if they bank with an institution connected to the Radius network. 
* Parts to the system: 
    * Driver DB where we store wallet information if driver has a Radius compatible wallet. 
    * DB Connection to earnings ledger and logic  
    * DB Connection to Radius 
* Demo:  
    1. Driver DB: Show a pre-registered driver 1234, who has added their Radius wallet information (because they have a bank that supports Radius wallets) and updated preferences to be paid per delivery (rather than paid biweekly)
    2. Earnings ledger connection: In the mock earning ledger, we (as DoorDash) manually add $10 because driver just completed delivery. 
    3. Driver DB: that checks ledger every 30s if any of the Driver IDs in our DB updated with new balances? 
    4. Logic: InstaPay notes that driver 1234 has updated balance. InstaPay logic check if ‚Äòwants instant payouts‚Äô value is True. If true, initiate USDC transfer to wallet ID via Radius 


# Biz Viability
InstaPay relies on the assumption that banks such as Chase will start providing accounts in USDC. 
The business viability comes from providing the transfers that are proven needed and used now but without the intermediary fees.

e5d6c5a1-1010-4df0-9ddc-d8865868f9b1,Gradient Checkpointing,GPU memory profiling experiments on gradient checkpointing,"Gradient checkpointing is a method to save memory by recomputing activations in training. This is a simplified version of how checkpointing works at a high level:

![Image](https://storage.googleapis.com/club-site-images/projects/a7ad7ad9-f7c4-4390-a3cd-ec8060195263-Screenshot_2025-04-13_at_8.15.19_PM.png)

In a nutshell, when you wrap a torch module with the torch checkpoint API in the forward pass, it stores the value of  the input and returns the output of the module, discarding all intermediate activations. Then, at the time of the backward pass, it fetches the saved input and performs the forward of the module again, using the output gradient to perform a regular backward pass within the segment of the computational graph defined by the wrapped torch module.
The trade-off here is that less GPU memory is needed since we are ditching the intermediate gradients, but we must perform additional forward passes at the time we need to backpropagate. In practice, and as can be seen in our experiments below, the memory impact is quite substantial with respect to the impact in computation time that the additional intermediate recomputation overhead introduces.

**Compute-Memory Tradeoff**

To investigate this further we have created a basic [implementation](https://github.com/sundai-research/sft-vrum/pull/1/) (https://github.com/sundai-research/sft-vrum/pull/1/) that enables supervised fine-tuning of the Qwen2.5-7B-instruct model. We have also exposed a way of choosing how many transformer decoder layers to skip checkpointing on. Increasing number of layers we skip this operation on increases the peak memory required to do a gradient step as seen here:

![Image](https://storage.googleapis.com/club-site-images/projects/da4b7061-df46-4841-8e1f-81fff337ac46-big_plot.png)


Notably, the difference between checkpointing every layer and checkpointing only every second layer almost doubles the memory footprint and the throughput, as expected.  However, it was surprising to us to observe that skipping more checkpoints after that only increases the memory peak while keeping the tokens per second constant.

To investigate this further we visualized the memory requirements 


We used pytorch memory profile to examine the memory traces with various levels of checkpointing.

## Introduction

With this hack our aim was to see how well LLMs are at playing text-based games. Our initial goal was to explore text based game environments and see how LLMs perform on some of these games. We chose two games for today, TextWorld and Liar's Dice.

We planned to first get the baseline performance with the teacher models and then synthetically generate data to fine-tune the student model and see how much is it able to learn from the supervised training process.

We were able to evaluate how the teacher models perform with and without reasoning mode on the mentioned games.


## Data
**BALROG**

BALROG is a benchmarking framework designed to evaluate the in-context learning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) across various interactive environments. It decouples inference-time prompting strategies from underlying models, facilitating rapid prototyping and consistent evaluations. BALROG includes environments like BabyAI, Crafter, MiniHack, and TextWorld, each testing different skills such as navigation, exploration, and resource management. In TextWorld, agents interact with text-based games like ""Treasure Hunter,"" ""The Cooking Game,"" and ""Coin Collector,"" requiring them to perform tasks through natural language commands. BALROG's design emphasizes rigorous testing of LLMs' decision-making and planning abilities in complex, dynamic scenarios. ([balrog-ai.github.io][1], [balrog-ai.github.io][2])

**TextArena**

TextArena is an open-source platform offering a diverse collection of over 57 competitive text-based games aimed at training and evaluating agentic behaviors in large language models (LLMs). It encompasses single-player, two-player, and multi-player environments, emphasizing dynamic social skills such as negotiation, theory of mind, and deception. TextArena features an online play system where models can compete against humans or other models, with real-time TrueSkill scoring. Designed for extensibility, it allows researchers and developers to easily add new games, adapt the framework, and test models. Comprehensive documentation and examples are available on its GitHub repository and official website. ([arXiv][3])

**Example: TextWorld Dataset in BALROG**

In BALROG's TextWorld environment, the ""Treasure Hunter"" task challenges an agent to navigate a 20-room maze to find a specific object. The game includes locked doors and containers, requiring the agent to locate keys and unlock pathways. Commands available to the agent include:([balrog-ai.github.io][2])

* `look`: Describe the current room.
* `go <direction>`: Move in a specified direction (north, east, south, or west).
* `open <object>`: Open doors or containers.
* `take <object>`: Pick up visible objects.
* `unlock <object> with <key>`: Unlock doors or containers using keys.([balrog-ai.github.io][4])

The agent must strategize to efficiently explore the maze, manage inventory, and interact with objects to achieve the goal within a limited number of steps. ([balrog-ai.github.io][2])

## Models
**Teacher Models:**

Qwen3-235B-A22B-FP8-Tput: This 235B parameter Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model activates 22B parameters per inference, offering high-throughput and cost-efficient inference. Its hybrid instruction-following and reasoning capabilities make it ideal for complex tasks like those in BALROG's TextWorld environment.

Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct: An instruction-tuned model with 32B parameters, Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct exhibits enhanced capabilities in instruction following, long-text generation, and structured data understanding. These features are particularly beneficial for dynamic, multi-agent games such as Liar's Dice in TextArena.

**Student Model:**

Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct: Serving as our student model, this 1.5B parameter instruction-tuned model is designed for resource-constrained scenarios. It benefits from distilled knowledge of the larger teacher models, aiming to retain performance while reducing computational demands.


## Progress

*Synthetic Data for TextWorld* - We were able to generate around ~2000 training samples with correct actions to fine-tune the student model on.

We experimented with thinking and non-thinking mode, and we found that non-thinking is more robust for the Qwen3-235B-A22B-FP8-Tput model.

*Synthetic Data for Liar's Dice* - We simulated 50K games between two Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct models and generated over 65K valid sample to train the student model. 
## Results

We evaluated and let our fine-tuned student model compete with its teacher model itself and below are out finding:

**Liar's Dice**
Out of **10** games of Liar's Dice **9** of the games were won by the student model and only **1** was won by the teacher model.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Quality vs. Cost ‚Üí AI-generated visuals require massive iterations to get a single usable frame. I went through 20+ versions per shot, burning through credits quickly. Balancing automation vs. production costs is key.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Unstable Physics & Visual Inconsistencies ‚Üí Characters sometimes had 4 fingers, or their heads faced backward while bodies forward. AI struggles with spatial awareness, making full automation unreliable w/o human intervention.
3Ô∏è‚É£ The Role of Creators is Evolving ‚Üí We‚Äôre moving from ‚Äúcreating from scratch‚Äù to curating & directing AI outputs. The best filmmakers may not be the best animators‚Äîbut the best prompt engineers. Studios will need a hybrid workflow‚ÄîAI for fast prototyping, humans for refinement.
4Ô∏è‚É£ The Rise of AI-Generated IP ‚Üí If AI can generate an entire film, who owns it? Legal frameworks are still catching up, but this could disrupt Hollywood, animation, and content licensing.

A cybersecurity demonstration tool that shows how audio can be manipulated to create misleading content by selectively extracting and recombining segments from original recordings.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Educational Purpose Only

This tool is designed **strictly for educational and cybersecurity awareness purposes**. It demonstrates how easily media can be manipulated to create false narratives, highlighting the importance of media literacy and verification in the digital age.

## Overview

The Fake Conversations Generator automates the process of:
1. Downloading audio from YouTube videos
2. Transcribing the audio with word-level timing information
3. Analyzing the transcript to identify segments that could be recombined to create misleading content
4. Extracting and combining those segments to create a fake audio clip

bf3fd58f-0f07-4d9b-a2a0-01a4582ce3ae,ChuckleBox,Capture the peak laugh-of-the-night moments from hangouts with your friends.,"# **Chuckle Box: AI-Powered Humor Highlights from Yo Conversations**

In the age of digital memories, SundAI Club has developed a unique solution to capture those fleeting moments of hilarity that often slip away after long conversations or game nights. Visit **Chuckle Box**, our latest AI hack that turns hours of audio into a curated list of the funniest moments.

## **Project Overview**

**‚ÄúChuckle Box‚Äù** aims to solve a common problem: remembering and sharing the best jokes and witty exchanges from lengthy social gatherings. Our system processes up to four hours of audio, identifying laughter and extracting the surrounding context to create a highlight reel of humor.

### **Here's how it works:**

1. **Recording:** Users capture their conversation using a simple iPhone recorder.  
2. **Uploading:** The audio file (mp4 or mp3) is uploaded to our application.  
3. **Transcription:** Our system transcribes the entire conversation.  
4. **Laughter Detection:** A machine learning model identifies moments of laughter in the audio.  
5. **Highlight Extraction:** Large Language Models (LLMs) analyze the transcribed text around laughter moments to identify and summarize the jokes or punchlines.  
6. **Presentation:** Users receive a list of summarized funny moments, ready to be remembered and shared.

## **Technical Breakdown**

### **Front End Team**
Our UI experts focused on creating an intuitive interface for audio upload and result presentation. The challenge was to make the process as seamless as possible, ensuring users could easily access their humor highlights.

### **Back End Team**
This team split into two sub-groups:

1. **Machine Learning Sub-Team:**  
   They tackled the core of our project - accurate laughter detection. Using an open-source machine learning model and a GPU instance for faster inference, they fine-tuned the system to recognize various types of laughter in different audio environments.

2. **Integration Sub-Team:**  
   This group managed the transcription process and ensured smooth end-to-end integration. They worked on optimizing the pipeline to keep runtime within acceptable limits, a significant challenge given the large audio files and complex processing involved.

The most innovative aspect of **‚ÄúChuckle Box‚Äù** is its combination of laughter detection and context understanding. By using LLMs to analyze the conversation around detected laughter, we're able to provide meaningful and genuinely funny highlights, not just moments of noise.

0934849c-fe11-4ebc-a786-6360cca00043,Satellite Image Object Rec,"Extract objects (buildings, road, etc.) from satellite images.","# Product Overview

We use deep learning to mark the progress of construction work based on satellite images, to provide the land developers a timely and accurate project update, which they‚Äôd otherwise spend $xxk/month to check.

________________________________________

# Our Approach 

We used Semantic Segmentation to categorize the pixels of the satellite image into four categories: buildings, roads, vegetation, and everything else. 

## In-Scope

Given the time limit of Sundai's time, we used models to detect objects in satelitte images, and segmented them in pixel level. 

## Out-of-Scope 

If in a corporation setting and given more time, we could try either use Image with ground truth + Train the ML model, or use existing ML models + Test and Fine-tune the model. We would also work on the function to show the construction progress based on our detection results.

________________________________________

# Our Accomplishment

Explored prior work and existing tools and chose the approach;

Created GitHub and Google Shared Drive to collaborate work;

Prepared satellite image in GeoTIFF format, and a CAD design of the same jobsite in GeoJSON format.

1. Data Preparation: Transform the GeoTIFF satellite images to JPG format, ready for Deep Learning model.
2. Leveraged Inception Resnetv2 Unet to do sementic segmentation based on processed satelitte image data, output segementation results as masks into PNG format.
3. Combined original satelitte image, CAD image, and predicted masks, show final visualization results.

# Limitations

- Since we used pretrained models, the arrcuracy is not ideal.
- Limited images are available now.

# Next Steps

- Convert the output of Deep Learning model to KML or SHP format.
- Fine-tune models based on images that better suits our use case.
- Determine metrics to calculate the percentage of works that have been done by workers.
- Create smaller granularity in detection.

1d288766-c1c4-4ba0-ac95-5e53b1eff906,Camo AI,"CamoAI protects privacy by obfuscating faces, blocking AI detection, and enabling ID verification.","CamoAI is a cutting-edge privacy project designed to protect digital identities using AI-driven obfuscation techniques. It ensures users maintain control over their personal data while preventing unauthorized AI recognition and enabling secure identification when needed. CamoAI consists of three key features:

AI-Proof Image Protection: https://web-production-5b1b.up.railway.app/

CamoAI‚Äôs image protection system enhances privacy by making faces less detectable to AI while preserving visual quality. Built with a Python Flask backend and a JavaScript-powered frontend, it leverages OpenCV, NumPy, and Pillow to apply strategic interference patterns‚Äîsuch as noise, grid overlays, and color preservation‚Äîto reduce AI recognition. It includes a confidence scoring system, real-time feedback, and AI recognition testing. Deployed on Render.com with GitHub integration, it supports asynchronous uploads and secure file handling. Future updates will include batch processing, video support, and API access.

Snapchat AI Privacy Filter: https://mariagorskikh.github.io/camoai-landing/snapchat.html

The CamoAI Snapchat filter prevents AI from identifying and linking faces in public Snapchat content. Developed using Snapchat Lens Studio, the filter applies real-time modifications to block AI-based facial detection while maintaining usability. Tested with Betaface, it effectively prevents AI from recognizing facial features, ensuring complete privacy. The filter is publicly available on Snapchat and can be accessed via a QR code.

Secure ID Submission: https://privacy-safe-photos-production.up.railway.app/

CamoAI enables secure identity verification by obfuscating facial images, making them unreadable to humans while remaining recognizable to AI. Inspired by the research paper ""Face Obfuscation Rendering via Backpropagation Refinement Scheme,"" this feature helps mitigate bias in sensitive cases, such as identity verification for Muslim women or other privacy-conscious users. It ensures personal data remains secure while allowing AI-driven authentication when required. The official GitHub repository provides implementation details and installation guidelines.

Through these innovations, CamoAI empowers users to safeguard their digital identity, protect personal images from AI surveillance, and ensure secure and ethical AI-driven identification.",Maria Gorskikh,False,1.0,"<a href=""https://sundai.club/projects/1d288766-c1c4-4ba0-ac95-5e53b1eff906"" style=""color: black; text-decoration: none; target=""_blank"">Camo AI</a>","Camo AI: CamoAI protects privacy by obfuscating faces, blocking AI detection, and enabling ID verification."

613dd9fb-75c8-49c7-9583-d7997ad1e675,Puzzled-Reasoning,Train an LLM on puzzles to teach them how to reason.,"# Solving Puzzles with Small Language Models

## A Reasoning Puzzle

Consider this puzzle:

> I'm thinking of two distinct positive integers \( x \) and \( y \) (with \( x < y \)). The sum of \( x \) and \( y \) is 47, and the sum of their squares is 1145. What are \( x \) and \( y \)?

How would you solve it?

In today's experiment, we focused on teaching a smaller language model (LLM) to solve puzzles like this one by leveraging solutions generated by a larger, more powerful model.

## Experiment Setup

Our process involved several key steps:

1. **Problem Selection**: We identified various interesting puzzle types that a smaller model typically struggled to solve.
2. **Synthetic Puzzle Generation**: We created synthetic datasets by automatically generating examples for these puzzle types.
3. **Generating High-Quality Solutions**: We then used the powerful `QwQ-32B` model to generate detailed, step-by-step solutions for each puzzle.
4. **Dataset Creation**: Verified solutions were compiled into a dataset for supervised fine-tuning.
5. **Fine-Tuning a Smaller Model**: Using this dataset, we fine-tuned the smaller `Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B-instruct` model. This fine-tuning was carried out efficiently with our minimal and fast [training library](https://github.com/Red-Hat-AI-Innovation-Team/mini_trainer).

We evaluated the newly trained models against the original baseline model. The fine-tuned models showed significant improvements, performing better not only on puzzles similar to those in the training dataset but also demonstrating enhanced reasoning capabilities on tasks outside of the training domain.



## Datasets
1. SumSquared: This dataset is a simple mathematical puzzle dataset focused on identifing the individual numbers given the sum and sum of squared of the individual numbers.
> I‚Äôm thinking of two distinct positive integers x and y (with x < y).
The sum of x and y is 47, and the sum of their squares is 1145.
What are x and y?



2. DieRoll: This dataset is a probalility heave die roll scenario dataset.
> What is the probability that the sum is between 10 and 12, inclusive, when rolling 2 8-sided dice?
3. Climbing Stairs: This dataset focuses on evaluating the number of ways to climb a staircase of n steps given a set of step lengths, ie. the number of ways you can take the next step. 
> I'm thinking of a staircase with 8 stairs.You can take jumps of [1, 2] steps. How many ways can you get to the top of the staircase? Use one box to answer. Use no more than 5000 tokens.
4. Roundtable Seating: This dataset focuses on identifying the seating arrangement of n people in the circular roundtable given a set of clues/rules. It is ensured that there is one unique solution to the arrangement.
> Given Sam, Alex and Taylor what is the possible sitting arrangement in the round table given that:
> -  Sam is sitting between Alex and Taylor.
> - The person two seats to the right of Taylor is Sam. 
> - The person to the right of Taylor is not Sam.

5. Ordering logic puzzles: Here is an example:
> There are 6 items sold on 6 consecutive days. The items are numbered from 0 to 5 and the days are also numbered from 0 to 5. The following constraints apply:
> * Item 4 is not sold on day 3.
> * Items 5 and 4 are sold before item 0.
> * Items 1 and 3 are sold after item 5.
> * Item 2 is sold after item 4 and before item 0.

## Prompt:
We use the prompt below to trigger reasoning behavior from Qwen 32B Instruct for the SumSquared dataset:
> The user asks a question, and the Assistant solves it. The assistant first thinks about the reasoning process in the mind and then provides the user with the final answer. The reasoning process and answer are enclosed within <think> </think> and <answer> </answer> tags, respectively, i.e., <think> reasoning process here </think><answer> answer here </answer>. In the answer mention each unknown and its solution, for example, <answer> x=5 y=10 </answer>. Now the user asks you to solve a math reasoning problem.
> User:{quiz}
> Assistant: <think>

## Models

### Teacher Models

1. Qwen/QwQ-32B
2. Qwen/Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct

We used the Qwen family of models as teacher models fro synthetic data generation. We generated samples from QwQ with the reasoning and prompted the Instruct model to provide the thinking within the <think></think> tags, and parsed the responses to create the training set as input-output pairs.

### Student Model
1. Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct

We used a very small 1.5B instruct qwen model to learn from the teacher only using SFT. We trained on three different puzzle datasets and hence we got 3 different fine-tuned models.

## Results

## Vibe Checks

Below are a few vibe checks comparing Qwen 1.5B Instruct before and after SFT on SumSquared:

## Why the world needs Gertrude?

Imagine living in a place that isn‚Äôt your own, with little control over your daily routine. Every morning, you‚Äôre handed grapefruit juice, even though it makes you nauseous because it reminds you of a painful memory. You‚Äôve spent a lifetime immersed in literature, philosophy, and the arts, yet every group activity is a loud comedy screening that couldn‚Äôt feel further from who you are. This is the everyday reality for countless elderly residents in care homes where resources shortages leave little room for personalized care. Gertrude changes that by helping staff create meaningful, personalized activities based on the resident‚Äôs memories, interests, and personality‚Äîbecause everyone deserves to be seen and cared for as an individual.

## Product Description

Gertrude is a web app that helps caregivers plan activities tailored to each resident‚Äôs background and interests. By transforming interviews, PDFs, or audio recordings of residents‚Äô stories into structured profiles, the app suggests personalized events that make daily life more engaging and emotionally resonant.

## Opportunity

Most care facilities rely on one-size-fits-all programming due to understaffing and lack of tools. Yet studies show that older adults, especially those with dementia, respond better to activities tied to their personal history. Gertrude fills this gap by giving caregivers easy access to resident stories and turning them into meaningful, memory-based activity ideas.

## Vision

Our goal is to build a full platform for personalized elder care, where a resident‚Äôs story is as accessible as their medical record. In the future, the app could evolve into an interactive companion that helps residents share their stories and shapes how they‚Äôre cared for‚Äîevery step of the way.

## What did you build today?

We built the first version of Gertrude, with three core features:

- **Resident Story Uploads:** Text and audio memories are turned into structured, searchable profiles.
- **AI-Assisted Event Planning:** A chatbot suggests tailored activity ideas based on each resident‚Äôs story.
- **Event & Profile Navigation:** Staff can browse past and future events and view resident summaries with AI chat for context.

## Tech Stack & Features

### **Frontend:**

- React app, customized from Lovable + Cursor
- Pages: Sign In, Dashboard, Add Resident, Profile View, Event Calendar, AI-Assisted Event Creation

### **AI Integration:**

- Gemini 2.0 Flash chatbot that suggests activities based on resident stories

### Text & Audio Processing:

- Summarizes transcripts to extract key traits, hobbies, and timelines
- Generates visual life maps (timeline + tree structure)

### Backend:

- Django-based system managing users, events, stories, and chat history

## Will this project remain relevant for future generations of older adults?

As the aging population grows and expectations for personalized care increase, Gertrude addresses both today‚Äôs caregiver shortages and tomorrow‚Äôs demand for tech-enabled, human-centered elder care.

This project injects misleading and invisible HTML content into webpages to protect against **naive web scrapers**. It uses **OpenAI's GPT models** to automatically generate and insert fake elements such as hidden `<div>`s, fake emails, phone numbers, and HTML comments, preserving the original page functionality while making it harder for bots to extract meaningful data.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- ‚úÖ Automatically injects fake HTML content into all `.html` files in the `docs/` directory  
- ‚úÖ Uses GPT-4 (or GPT-3.5-turbo) to generate realistic-looking fake data  
- ‚úÖ Preserves all original content and functionality  
- ‚úÖ Adds misleading elements like:
  - Hidden `<div>` and `<span>` blocks  
  - HTML comments with fake names/emails/phone numbers  
  - Invisible placeholder content  
- ‚úÖ GitHub Actions workflow to automate content injection and PR creation

## üß† Why This Works

Naive web scrapers often rely on simple pattern matching and structural assumptions. By injecting:

- Comments with fake data
- Hidden but realistic-looking elements
- Obfuscated signals

...you can confuse and degrade the quality of the data collected by low-effort bots.

Leveraging the power of AI and transcript parsing, the app estimates a student's potential SAT Math and English scores based on their academic background, and provides detailed, tailored study plans to maximize performance.

Students begin by uploading their academic transcript (as an image or PDF), which the app automatically processes using OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to extract a list of completed courses and corresponding grades. These extracted courses are then categorized into relevant SAT subject areas (such as Algebra, Geometry, Pre-Calculus for Math; and English, AP Lang, Writing for English). Based on the depth and difficulty of courses taken, a predictive algorithm estimates likely SAT scores for Math and English.

Tech Stack: Tesseract for parsing & image reading, react/next.js for frontend. Mistral: Mixtral 8x7B Instruct for the personalized ai study plan.

Once the scores are estimated, the app uses a powerful AI model (Gemini Pro) to generate a personalized day-by-day study plan for each student. This plan adapts to each student's strengths and weaknesses, emphasizing topics they are less familiar with and reinforcing existing knowledge. Additionally, the AI considers any gaps in coursework (such as missing Geometry or Writing courses) and proactively recommends focused review and practice in those areas.

By automatically analyzing transcripts and combining predictive modeling with AI-driven study guidance, this project provides an effortless and deeply customized SAT preparation experience. It is ideal for students seeking to maximize their scores in a more targeted and time-efficient way, without the burden of lengthy diagnostics or one-size-fits-all test prep strategies.

85e41fc2-bc22-4caf-b778-a200aac690eb,Knostos,Enhance your relationships through greater self-awareness.,"Knostos is a pioneering digital platform designed to enhance self-awareness, nurture emotional intelligence, and enrich interpersonal relationships.

Inspired by the principles of Internal Family Systems (IFS), Knostos applies cutting-edge GPT-based natural language processing to analyze users‚Äô personal chat histories, helping them identify and better understand their internal ‚Äúparts.‚Äù 

These parts‚Äîsometimes referred to as sub-personalities‚Äîcan significantly influence how we feel about ourselves, how we communicate, and how we connect with others. 

By facilitating deeper self-exploration and targeted insights, Knostos empowers individuals, families, business partners, and close friends to navigate conflicts, repair fractured relationships, and promote harmonious interactions.

# Foundation in Internal Family Systems

Developed by Dr. Richard C. Schwartz, IFS offers a conceptual framework that views the mind as a constellation of ‚Äúparts,‚Äù each with its own distinct perspective and protective or reactive role. At the center of this system is the ‚ÄúSelf,‚Äù which represents our core essence‚Äîa place of calmness, curiosity, and compassion. When various parts become triggered, they can overshadow the Self and manifest in ways that escalate conflict, trigger negative emotions, or create barriers to communication. Common examples of such parts include:

**Managers:** These are protective parts that proactively manage our environment to prevent pain or vulnerability. They might become controlling, perfectionistic, or hypervigilant in their efforts to keep the individual safe.

**Firefighters:** These parts step in when overwhelming feelings or situations are perceived; they seek immediate relief through behaviors such as avoidance, numbing, or overindulgence.

**Exiles:** The vulnerable parts that carry deep-seated pain, fear, or shame. Managers and Firefighters work to protect Exiles from being re-exposed to hurtful experiences.

By shining light on each part‚Äôs intentions and fears, IFS aims to bring harmony within the individual‚Äôs internal system. Instead of trying to eliminate these parts, IFS practitioners welcome and soothe them, engaging them in a healing and integrative process that restores balance.

# The Knostos Approach

Knostos incorporates these core principles of IFS and applies them to communication patterns in real-world contexts. The platform operates on the premise that individuals will find it easier to explore their inner parts when given meaningful feedback on the patterns in their everyday language‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs daily journaling, text messages, or conversation threads with loved ones.

**Gathering User Data:** Knostos begins by analyzing chat histories that users export themselves. The platform is designed so that personal data is processed locally on the user‚Äôs own machine, ensuring privacy and data security.

**GPT Trained on IFS Literature:** To ensure that Knostos accurately identifies internal parts, the tool‚Äôs underlying GPT engine is trained on seminal texts in Internal Family Systems. This targeted training helps the AI detect recurring themes, emotional triggers, and relationship dynamics through an IFS-informed lens.

**Part Identification and Analysis:** Once the text data is uploaded, Knostos leverages natural language processing (NLP) to infer potential parts that may be influencing the user‚Äôs communication. For instance, if a user tends to show anxious or controlling behaviors in their messages, Knostos might highlight a ‚ÄúManager‚Äù part. If there is a pattern of avoidance or sudden withdrawal when conflicts arise, Knostos might point to a ‚ÄúFirefighter‚Äù mechanism.

**Personalized Feedback Loop:** After analyzing chat logs, Knostos generates a comprehensive report mapping identified parts, their roles, and common triggers. Users gain insights into how these sub-personalities may be collaborating or clashing, opening the door to deeper self-reflection and more informed communication strategies.

**Actionable Recommendations:** Knostos doesn‚Äôt just leave users with a static overview. It also offers practical exercises and guidance, grounded in IFS methodologies, to help individuals practice curiosity, self-compassion, and direct communication. This might include journaling prompts, mindfulness tips, or suggestions for open and empathic dialogues with key people in the user‚Äôs life.

**Enhancing Relationships Across Contexts:**
One of the most powerful applications of Knostos is how it bridges self-understanding with conflict resolution and relationship-building. By helping individuals identify the parts at play within themselves and in their interactions, Knostos can facilitate healthier, more empathetic communication in different relational contexts:

**Family Dynamics:** Family systems often harbor long-standing grievances and patterns of interaction. Knostos can help users pinpoint the protective parts that might be preserving family discord and guide them to approach tense situations with a spirit of curiosity and compassion. By doing so, family members can break cycles of blame or defensiveness and pave the way for genuine reconciliation.

**Professional Settings:** Co-founders, business partners, and colleagues frequently experience misunderstandings related to communication styles, perceived power imbalances, or unspoken expectations. Knostos offers a new lens through which to understand workplace tensions, enabling individuals to see beyond surface-level disagreements and cultivate a cooperative environment founded on mutual respect.

**Close Friendships:** Friendships, like any relationships, can suffer when unrecognized emotional patterns persist unchecked. Through targeted analysis of conversational data (e.g., text messages or emails), Knostos reveals how specific parts of us might sabotage or elevate our friendship dynamics. This clarity paves the way for candid, kind, and affirming exchanges‚Äîempowering both parties to deepen trust and connection.

**Data Privacy and Ethical Considerations**
Knostos takes data privacy extremely seriously. Because the tool analyzes highly personal conversations, all processing occurs locally on the user‚Äôs own hardware. The platform does not send chat histories to external servers or store them in the cloud. 

Instead, it uses on-device computations to generate insights and recommendations. This approach ensures that individuals have complete control and ownership over their personal data.

In addition, Knostos encourages responsible usage by reminding individuals of the sensitivities involved in analyzing private communications. Users are encouraged to seek professional guidance and therapeutic support when exploring areas that feel overwhelming or triggering.

# Use Cases and Impact

Knostos‚Äôs unique blend of IFS psychology and AI-driven analysis offers a rich spectrum of potential benefits:

**Personal Growth:** Individuals seeking more clarity about their own emotional landscapes can benefit from a user-friendly tool that highlights tendencies, triggers, and motivations.

**Couples and Family Therapy:** Therapists might incorporate Knostos‚Äôs analytics into sessions, helping clients understand patterns in their everyday communication and track progress over time.

**Conflict Resolution:** Business partners or team leaders who frequently butt heads can gain insight into how each participant‚Äôs parts might be sparring. This knowledge can de-escalate tension and promote cooperative problem-solving.

**Preventive Maintenance:** Much of our emotional well-being and interpersonal satisfaction depend on proactive self-awareness. Knostos empowers users to develop robust self-understanding before conflicts become intractable.

# Looking Ahead

While Knostos is already making strides in how people explore their inner systems, the future holds promising developments. Integrating advanced GPT models that continuously update their knowledge of IFS breakthroughs may enhance the specificity and accuracy of part identification. Further, Knostos plans to build optional integration with popular journaling apps and stress-management trackers, allowing users to track progress and adapt their strategies in real-time.

By fusing the foundational concepts of Internal Family Systems with the speed and versatility of artificial intelligence, Knostos pushes the boundaries of what‚Äôs possible in emotional intelligence and relationship enrichment. In a world marked by constant communication‚Äîyet often shallow understanding‚ÄîKnostos offers a potent path for reconnection: with our deepest selves and with the people who matter most.

# Tech Stack

The Knostos MVP was created using [OpenWebUI](https://openwebui.com), an open source self-hosted AI interface designed to operate entirely offline.

The reason this was chosen is because of the privacy concerns with sending one's sensitive chat transcripts to a public cloud-based provider such as OpenAI.

The chat transcripts can be uploaded by the user, and are cited in the responses provided by the LLM.

OpenWebUI uses [Ollama](https://ollama.com) to access locally running LLMs, such as [Llama 3](https://www.llama.com/). We tried to use the latest Llama 3.3, but it was too memory intensive to run on a 32GB Macbook Pro (M1). Instead, we used
llama3.2:1b-instruct-q4_K_M which was quite performant.

OpenWebUI was configured with a custom knowledgebase to provide [RAG capabilities](https://docs.openwebui.com/features/rag) and context around Internal Family Systems (IFS), and a custom prompt based on [this one](https://github.com/jamesarcher9000/ifschat/blob/main/prompt).

The [voice input and hands-free voice call features](https://docs.openwebui.com/features/#%EF%B8%8F-voice--accessibility) were enabled using open source speech-to-text (STT) and text-to-speech libraries (TTS). 
# Future roadmap

- Give Knostos a [long-term memory](https://github.com/open-webui/pipelines/blob/main/examples/filters/mem0_memory_filter_pipeline.py) capabilty so that it can learn from previous interactions, in the same way a therapist learns more about you from multiple sessions.

- Optionally remove any personally identifiable information (PII) using something like [Presidio](https://github.com/open-webui/pipelines/blob/main/examples/filters/presidio_filter_pipeline.py) to anonymize the chat transcripts. 

- Integrate [Llava](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/llava-large-language-and-vision-assistant/) for analyzing images, such as photos or other images that may be attached to chat transcripts. [Pipeline example](https://github.com/open-webui/pipelines/blob/main/examples/filters/dynamic_ollama_vision_filter_pipeline.py)

# Our Approach 

We first fill the polygon with minimum-sized lots, and then connect the edges of the lots using MST (Minimum Spanning Tree). 

## In-Scope

- 2-D polygon. We assume the ground is flat.

## Out-of-Scope 

- The input cannot be 3-D.
- The sketch wouldn't contain any facilities beyond roads and lots.


________________________________________

- input_polygon.geojson has the input polygon. 
- lot_sketch.py is the program to generate roads and lots. When running the program, it'll ask the user to provide the Minimum lot size (in square feet), Minimum front line length (in feet), and Road width (in feet).
- lot_sketch.geojson is the output sketch.

Problem and Opportunity
We interviewed various types of journalists to identify the primary challenges in story writing or television news communication. We discovered that journalists strive to stay ahead of the obvious, seeking compelling topics to write and research. Additionally, as emphasized by journalists, their objective is to ‚Äúcommunicate the truth‚Äù, sourcing accurate evidence for their stories as swiftly as possible. For this reason we found great opportunities to help journalists to identify new stories and validate and visualize different sources to validate their hypothesis.

A research co-pilot that helps journalists to find ‚Äúthe needle in the haystack‚Äù to uncover news-worthy insights.


What we built
When a user goes to AI-Newshound, they can search for a specific topic and visualize trends. We ingest articles, convert them into embeddings, and generate a 2D visualization, which is then plotted and rendered with Streamlit.


Development Process
Co-creating with the user:

Will Knight, journalist at Wired, joined since the beginning of the hack taking the role of the User-Lead.  


We brainstormed a list of potential ideas based on Will‚Äôs experience and user research with others from the week before. Trends stood out as an important topic, and after brainstorming 25+ ideas, we moved forward building Weekly reports on top AI papers.

We started working, but it wasn‚Äôt long before our first pivot. One of our members came back from lunch talking excitedly about Pathfinder, a tool to visualize Arxiv papers. Inspired, we showed it to Will, who said that the previous tool made something he‚Äôd do himself faster, but this new direction opened up a way to do research he‚Äôs never had access to before.


Technical development:

We started with the goal of putting an MVP 0 together, we broke into groups and each of us pulled data for ‚ÄúAI Agents‚Äù from a different API source.  


The APIs we used for searching are:

MediaStack for News
Arxiv for Research Papers
Hacker News with Algolia
Reddit API


We tested with the topic ‚ÄúAI Agents,‚Äù pulling content from each of the sources below. 


Some of the limitations we dealt with around the API were (1) the MediaStack API only showed short descriptions of articles and not the full article and (2) Arxiv has an open API, but cut us off after just a few queries. 


After getting the text from these different sources (we got ~25 articles on AI agents from each source), we stored them as embeddings for comparison. Embeddings store documents as lists of numbers, which can be used to compare  


UMAP is a technique used to reduce the dimensionality of embeddings, which are numerical representations of text, into just two dimensions. This allows for direct comparison and visualization. In our exploration of various embeddings, we found that SentenceTransformers and OpenAI performed similarly. However, we opted to continue with SentenceTransformers due to its faster processing speed and the advantage of being freely available.",leaps,False,0.5,"<a href=""https://sundai.club/projects/d9f47f9d-d65e-45df-9547-00afc4344a7f"" style=""color: black; text-decoration: none; target=""_blank"">AI News - Hound</a>",AI News - Hound: Research co-pilot to uncover news-worthy insights for AI journalists

98586cf0-796f-48ad-9385-c2f71396c75e,Binary Reasoning,We see how good GPT is at 20 questions,"**Intro**
We wanted to examine ChatGPT's reasoning abilities: that is, can models such as o1 and o3 truly reason, or do they simply regurgitate the patterns observed in their training set? 

We examine this today through the lens of efficiency: Given a large set of possibilities, how rapidly can the model identify characteristics that effectively reduce the candidate pool? Specifically, we conducted an experiment where ChatGPT was prompted to play the game ""20 Questions,"" with the explicit goal of guessing the correct answer in as few questions as possible. While the optimal theoretical approach would be a binary search‚Äîselecting questions that evenly partition the remaining possibilities‚Äîthe model was not informed of this strategy and had to independently generate its questions. This allowed us to evaluate the model‚Äôs implicit capacity for information-efficient questioning and decision-making.

**Analysis**
To evaluate this model, we first compiled a dataset of 500 names, including both contemporary and historical public figures. We then prompted a GPT-4o-mini model to guess the specific individual we had selected from this list, using as few yes/no questions as possible. Responses to these yes/no questions were generated by a second, separate model.

To quantify efficiency, we tracked two metrics:

(1) Remaining Candidate Pool Size: The number of possible individuals still under consideration after each question.

(2) Deviation from Optimal Split: How far each question deviated from a perfectly balanced 50/50 partition. A perfect 50/50 split corresponds to a deviation of 0, while a 70/30 split corresponds to a deviation of 0.2, measured on a scale from 0 to 1.

We visualized both metrics across the course of each experimental run to assess the model's efficiency in information gathering and candidate elimination. 

**Results**
One high-effort reasoning run is illustrated below:

![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rylpxT0ggg.png)

Using the same character but with low-effort we got this result.

![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ry5hE60egg.png)

Here we can see that on `low effort` the number of turns it took to guess was 7 instead of 5. And also, we can see that the split factors were a lot higher for the `low-effort` reaching 90-10% split in the third question vs 65-35% for the `high-effort` version.


**Conclusion**

In our results we found that models already know that the optimal strategy to solve the guess name problem is to do a perfect binary search, and we also show that using more test-time compute improves the ability of the model to get much cleaner splits.

It's also important to note that when using 100 characters, getting questions that would give you a 50% split is extremely hard for humans since the working memory needed to creatively come up with good questions is an np-hard problem.

6d557b8e-3a89-44a2-8fd2-77fbd7bc8902,Conditional text embeddings,We can use LLM embeddings to map data in 2D. Here we are making these projections depend on context.,"**Understanding Embedding Projection Behavior**

Modern natural language processing relies heavily on vector embeddings to represent textual information in high-dimensional mathematical spaces. These embeddings, typically consisting of hundreds or thousands of dimensions, capture semantic relationships between words, phrases, and documents. However, to make these representations interpretable for human analysis and visualization, we must project them into lower-dimensional spaces a process that inevitably involves information loss and transformation.

This investigation examines how various methodological choices in the embedding projection pipeline affect the resulting visualizations and their utility for information retrieval tasks. Using a complete literary work as our test corpus, we systematically analyze the impact of different parameters on embedding behavior and projection quality.

**Experimental Framework**

Dataset and Preprocessing: Our analysis utilized a complete digital text corpus (Harry Potter) that had been preprocessed into discrete chunks of approximately 256 tokens each. Each chunk was embedded using OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large model, resulting in 1,536-dimensional vector representations. This setup provided a realistic scenario for analyzing how different methodological choices affect embedding behavior in production environments.

Variables Under Investigation

Chunk Subset Size: We examined the effects of analyzing different quantities of text chunks (50, 100, 200, and 500 chunks) to understand the relationship between dataset size and projection quality.

Projection Methods: Three distinct dimensionality reduction techniques were compared:

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for linear dimensionality reduction
t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) for non-linear clustering preservation
Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) for balanced local and global structure preservation

Distance Metrics: We evaluated three approaches to measuring semantic similarity:

Cosine similarity (direction-based, magnitude-invariant)
Euclidean distance (straight-line distance in vector space)
Manhattan distance (sum of absolute differences along each dimension)

Query Complexity: Different types of information retrieval queries were tested to understand how question complexity affects embedding performance:

Simple factual queries
Complex multi-faceted questions
Specific targeted inquiries
Abstract conceptual questions

**Methodology**

The experimental procedure consisted of five main phases:

Data Extraction: All chunk embeddings and associated text content were extracted from the existing vector database for comprehensive analysis.
Query Embedding Generation: Test queries were converted into the same 1,536-dimensional embedding space to enable direct comparison with document chunks.
Similarity Analysis: For each combination of query and distance metric, we calculated similarity scores between query embeddings and all chunk embeddings, then analyzed ranking correlations across different metrics.
Projection Testing: Each subset size was processed through all three projection methods, with quality metrics calculated to assess information preservation and clustering coherence.
Pattern Analysis: The resulting visualizations were analyzed for cluster formation, query positioning, and the preservation of semantic relationships across different parameter configurations.

**Evaluation Metrics**
Quantitative Measures:

Explained variance ratio (for PCA projections)
Neighborhood preservation scores (for non-linear methods)
Ranking correlation coefficients between distance metrics
Chunk diversity indices within subsets

Qualitative Assessments:

Semantic cluster coherence in 2D projections
Query positioning relative to relevant content clusters
Visual interpretability of resulting embeddings

Different query complexities exhibited varying sensitivity to methodological choices:

Different query types achieve highly unequal performance when searching through book embeddings. Narrative queries achieve the highest similarity scores (median ~0.49), followed by abstract and simple queries, while factual queries obtain the worst results (median ~0.28). This pattern reflects that embeddings and the book content (Harry Potter) are naturally aligned with narrative and conceptual information, but struggle to capture specific facts and precise data. 

![Image](https://storage.googleapis.com/club-site-images/projects/24a925e2-9783-415d-964e-f9d153d991ba-Screenshot_2025-05-18_at_19.50.22.png)

We systematically tested how the number of chunks analyzed (50, 100, 200, 500) affects projection quality and diversity by randomly sampling subsets from the complete book and applying PCA dimensionality reduction to each subset. Results reveal a counterintuitive finding: smaller subsets actually produce better 2D projections, with explained variance dropping from 13.1% (50 chunks) to 8.5% (500 chunks), while computational efficiency dramatically decreases with larger subsets. Chunk diversity peaks at around 200 chunks before plateauing, suggesting this represents the optimal content coverage without redundancy. 
Key insight: More data doesn't necessarily mean better visualizations - the 50-100 chunk range provides the clearest, most interpretable 2D projections (highest efficiency ~2.6), while 200 chunks offers the best balance between content diversity and computational resources, challenging the conventional ""bigger is better"" assumption in embedding analysis

While this analysis provides foundational insights into embedding projection behavior, it represents only a limited proof-of-concept that requires substantial expansion across multiple critical dimensions. Essential explorations include: cross-domain validation (technical, scientific, legal documents vs. narrative text), multilingual corpus analysis, systematic comparison of different embedding architectures (OpenAI vs. Sentence-BERT vs. domain-specific models), and comprehensive chunk size optimization (64-2048 tokens with varying overlap strategies). Most critically, this POC fails to address real-world utility , it optimizes mathematical metrics (explained variance, cosine similarity) without validating whether improved projections translate to better user experiences or more relevant search results. Missing elements include human relevance evaluation, downstream task performance (QA, summarization), scalability testing beyond 500 chunks, temporal dynamics of embedding spaces, and semantic interpretability of discovered clusters. The single-domain focus (Harry Potter) introduces significant domain bias, and the absence of ground truth relevance labels means we're measuring mathematical similarity rather than practical usefulness. Future work must bridge this evaluation gap through user studies, cross-domain robustness testing, and integration with real-world retrieval tasks to determine whether these projection insights actually improve information retrieval systems in practice.

This is an interesting project that uses AI agents to collaboratively generate short films! Here's what's going on:

1. The project uses the crewAI framework to create a team of specialized AI agents that work together to generate movie content.
2. The main agents in the system include:
   * Story Writer: Creates the movie script with scenes and characters
   * Title Generator: Creates compelling movie titles
   * Character Designer: Develops character details
   * Result Saver: Handles saving outputs to files
3. The system is structured to generate various components of a movie, including:
   * Story/script
   * Character descriptions
   * Music
   * Narration
   * Scenes
   * Title
4. The project is set up to use OpenAI's API (requires an API key) and can potentially integrate with various AI image and video generation tools like DALL-E, Flux, Sora, and Hailuo for visualization.
5. All outputs are organized and saved in a structured way, with each component (characters, music, narration, etc.) saved in separate text files within a timestamp-based directory structure.",Nikolay Vyahhi,False,0.5,"<a href=""https://sundai.club/projects/003b9bf9-0a67-44f5-b036-86efecef3867"" style=""color: black; text-decoration: none; target=""_blank"">Filmmaker</a>",Filmmaker: Agentic AI crew to generate a short film from 0 to masterpiece

520ed551-c258-4892-a72e-03beb68318e6,Future Mirror,"An AI tool connecting individuals to their future selves, boosting lifestyle changes to prevent deme","Brain health is a critical determinant of public health, particularly in the context of an aging global population and the rising prevalence of dementia. Dementia affects over 55 million people worldwide, and projections estimate that this number could triple by 2050 unless preventive measures are implemented. Recent research underscores the significance of brain health across the lifespan and highlights the substantial impact of modifiable lifestyle factors in reducing dementia risk. According to Livingston et al. (2024, The Lancet), up to 40% of dementia cases could be prevented or delayed by addressing key modifiable risk factors, including low educational attainment, hearing loss, obesity, hypertension, smoking, physical inactivity, social isolation, and diabetes. This underscores the importance of early interventions and sustained efforts to mitigate risk factors at both individual and societal levels.

However, it is extremely difficult to find the motivation to implement lifestyle-changes, especially if these choices will be rewarded only in a very distant future. One way of overcoming this hurdle is to connect with our ‚Äúfuture-self‚Äù, for example by interacting with a digital representation of the individual in the future. This process has been shown to increase one‚Äôs perceived self-efficacy, the belief in one‚Äôs ability to successfully perform specific tasks or achieve desired goals.

Our main goal is to build, spread, and commercialize an AI-based tool that enables individuals to optimize their lifestyle choices towards the prevention of dementia, by connecting them with their future-self.

Companies are spending $k to $M and larges teams on financial entries and reports. What if we use AI to automate the process and make it even better? 

In this MVP, we let the user upload the revenue, cost, and expense, for the bot to calculate the proforma and answer user questions.
________________________________________

# Our Approach 

We used Next.js at the front end and created flexible input windows for the user to provide their revenue, cost, and expense. The user can enter or paste their items and values freely. The data is then absorbed into a json file.

And then we created financial formulas to train the LLM bot to understand the data and questions.

The answer is provided in a chat window, mimicing the experience of ChatGPT. Answers would be given in both text and charts (charts are not completed yet).

When the Invoice comes, we'll parse the PDF file into a json file and update the Expense table (partially completed).


## In-Scope

Given the time limit of Sundai, we focused on the proforma and its related financials.

## Out-of-Scope 

If in a corporation setting and given more time, we could include more financial use cases.

________________________________________

# Our Accomplishments

- Created flexible input windows using Next.js;

- Created json file to store the data;

- Created financial formulas and trained the bot;

- Prepared a proforma case with realistic data.


# Next Steps

- Program more financial calculations into the bot.
- Generate charts.
- Update the proforma using the Invoice and Sales Contracts.

aae9effa-0134-48da-b42a-496f5bc04f60,Beats AI,Use AI to create custom multiple instrument samples and layer/mix them together. ,"# Revolutionizing Music Generation with Beats AI

## The Problem:
Creating music that blends various instruments and styles takes time and requires expertise. Many users struggle to generate high-quality music quickly due to:

- **Complexity**: Generating a cohesive music piece from multiple instruments can be a complex task, often requiring deep musical knowledge.
- **Cost**: Traditional music production tools are expensive, and generating music from multiple instruments can be labor-intensive.

## The Solution:
MusicGen.AI simplifies music creation by allowing users to generate custom music tracks with multiple instruments. Here's how:

- **Instrument Selection**: Users can select from a variety of instruments to create their desired sound.
- **Music Generation**: The AI generates music based on user input using Facebook's MusicGen model.
- **Review & Refine**: After the initial music is generated, users can review it and provide additional specifications. The music is regenerated based on these inputs, ensuring the final result is exactly as desired.

## How It Works:
1. **Instrument Selection**: 
   Users can choose from a variety of instruments (e.g., piano, guitar, drums, etc.) to create a music composition.

2. **Music Generation**: 
   The MusicGen model, powered by Facebook, processes the selected instruments and generates a music track based on the user's prompt.

3. **User Feedback**: 
   After hearing the initial track, users can provide feedback or modify the specifications to better match their vision.

4. **Regeneration & Finalization**: 
   The music is regenerated based on the updated specifications, and users can continue refining the track until they are satisfied.

5. **Final Result**: 
   The final result combines all the sounds from the selected instruments, creating a unique and personalized music track that meets the user‚Äôs specifications.

## Key Features:
- **Multi-Instrument Selection**: Users can choose multiple instruments for a rich and diverse sound.
- **Iterative Feedback Loop**: Users can provide feedback to refine and perfect the music.
- **Powered by Facebook's MusicGen Model**: High-quality, AI-generated music using cutting-edge technology.
- **Personalized Output**: The final music piece is tailored to the user‚Äôs specifications and preferences.

## Target Audience:
- **B2B**: Music producers, video editors, and game developers in need of custom soundtracks.
- **B2C**: Content creators, influencers, and anyone looking to generate personalized music for videos, podcasts, or projects.

## Future Improvements:
- **Enhanced Customization**: Adding more instruments and customization options for users.
- **Collaborative Features**: Enabling multiple users to collaborate on a single track creation.
- **Higher Audio Quality**: Improving the quality of generated audio and ensuring better blending of multiple instruments.

1fc2ee78-cb73-4d7c-ac07-4dcb17c17959,WebNovel Chatbots,Generate character chatbots from webnovels,"# Intro
Webnovels are fiction literature published via the internet. China, Japan and S.Korea have adopted this medium both from publishing and readers standpoints. There are few unique characteristics compared to Western literature.

# Problem
From seeing the success and novelty of Character AI, we focused on one aspect here, the uniqueness of tropes and characters from an entirely different domain of culture to generate AI characters.

# Solution
1. Get hundreds of chapters of a webnovel
2. Extract specific scenarios for a particular character
3. Index and fine-tune on those examples to try extract the persona and style of said character
4. Finish RAG pipeline and deploy instance
5. Integrate backend into Discord bot
6. Deploy

# Outcome
We deployed a Discord character bot and simple web chatbot for the main character in a popular S.Korean webnovel.
It was able to reference its own fictional experiences, however nailing the style requires more fine-tuning. Additionally, defining the environment in the chat and describing actions help set the context ‚Äì the absence of which was obvious.
Weirdly, sometimes:
- it started responding in Korean (despite purely English text as the original context).
- it gave some off-topic political responses.

# Team
Joey here, I'd like to shoutout,
- Artem: for carrying the fine-tuning process in extracting something quite abstract at the time, and for bringing the 'reliable big brother' vibes.
- Serge: for RAG'ing hundreds of chapters to a scale that made it possible to work with, and for his bias-for-action.
- Lea: for her snappy web implementation & testing, and her constant positive vibes.
- Diana: for her deeper market-research and GTM exploration, and her resiliency to dive into this.
- Joey (me): for implementing the Discord bot, backend hosting, and crawling the dark corners of the internet for the data we needed.

Lux is a multi-agent shopping companion that delivers curation of affordable health & longevity, fashion, and sustainable products. This project integrates Lux's proprietary amazon product agent and Mantis to visualize product options for a user query. Such a system can be useful to understand diversity and quality of product search results.

For the hackathon, time did not permit full integration of the two systems (UI-wise), which would be very useful b2b and b2c for exploration (b2c; embed mantis space to the app's ui), and product and query understanding (b2b: publishers, sales, marketplaces, etc). Still, the value of the proposal can be seen with what has been built, which delivers full mantis functionality over the space of products retrieved by Lux (amazon agent only). Lux is also handling exposing appropriate data to Mantis.

Overall, this integration would allow

ML Engs / Data Scientists : visualize retrieval diversity to best understand aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty of their search models and data.

Product analysts, marketers, PMs: understand diversity and quality of products being shown to users based on their searches. This can be useful to ""debugging"" engagement issues and implicit feedback from user sessions with the search product.

Users: With appropriate UI-UX integration, Mantis can be an excellent add-on for users to more easily and intuitively navigate the catalog of search results for their query (rather than scrolling through a SERP).",alexv,False,0.0,"<a href=""https://sundai.club/projects/b285263c-2a29-4232-b95b-8379d4677278"" style=""color: black; text-decoration: none; target=""_blank"">mantis-luxe</a>",mantis-luxe: Integrating Mantis and the Lux platform - visualizing product search results.

Vision: What should the complete product look like?
The final product is an Android application that reads incoming SMS messages in real time. Due to API restrictions on other platforms, Android was chosen for its open accessibility. Once installed, the app runs in the background, monitors incoming texts, evaluates them for risk, and communicates alerts to both the user and their family network.

MVP: What was built during the hack?
The MVP includes an Android emulator connected to a backend endpoint for real-time AI-based text evaluation. The system returns a classification indicating whether a message appears to be spammy or not.

Core Features and Tech Stack
Platform: Native Android app using React Native with Kotlin.,
AI Integration: LLM (via Wama) performs analysis on entire conversations. Early attempts at keyword filtering proved ineffective, leading to a full-message inference approach.,

Challenges: Major technical hurdles included the limited accessibility of APIs for popular messaging apps (e.g., WhatsApp, Messenger), which led the team to focus on SMS as a data source. Other platforms either blocked access or were too complex to integrate with at the MVP stage.


Relevance for Future Generations
Although the current focus is on today‚Äôs senior citizens, the app is designed to scale across different age groups, cultures, and use cases. As digital scams evolve, tools like Family Chat Alert will remain relevant for future generations of older adults.

Next Steps
Complete development of the Android app.,
Conduct usability testing with real senior users to validate interface design and user flow.,
Use feedback to refine both front-end design and backend AI functionality.,


Privacy Protection Readiness (Scale: 1‚Äì10)
Rating: 2
Current privacy measures rely on basic protections offered by the Android environment. The system still uses open APIs, and significant work remains to enhance security and ensure user data is handled responsibly.

AI Safety for Senior Users
The AI currently offers a limited, tightly scoped range of responses. It does not generate free-form dialogue and only flags risky content based on pre-trained models. The design minimizes the risk of misinformation or unintended interactions, ensuring a safer experience for vulnerable users.
