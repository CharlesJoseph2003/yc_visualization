355f4ff7-526b-494b-ab59-dbf4e0481e12,SafeClass,Pre-service AI classroom management simulator for teachers,"## The Problem

High school teachers are facing unprecedented levels of stress and burnout as they manage increasingly disruptive classrooms. Daily issues like cellphone use, disrespect, and occasional bullying or verbal abuse add to already heavy workloads. Many teachers are choosing to leave the profession earlier than expected, citing the cumulative strain.

- **77%** say their job is frequently stressful, and only **1 in 3** report being satisfied.  
- **72%** of high school teachers say cellphones are a major disruption.  
- **68%** have endured verbal abuse from students, and **1 in 10** face physical violence.

## The Solution

**How might we support high school teachers in strengthening their soft skills for classroom management in ways that reduce burnout and boost confidence?**

**What does ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù look like for them when using the simulation?**  
New teachers feel more confident, have techniques to manage students, improve classroom control, lower stress, build better student relationships, and experience better mental health as they no longer ""nerve out.""

**User validation**
Two school teachers iterated with the solution and provided actionable feedback that was incorporated into the platform features.

The tool provides potential matches by identifying synergistic relationships within the Sundai community. 

**Data Collection:**
The Discord bot interacts with the user to understand what the user is looking for - co-founder, sponsor, investor, new hacker buddy, etc. Using the user‚Äôs LinkedIn profile and their inputs related to their expertise and ability, we create a database of keywords that can be parsed to identify potential matches.

**Matching Process:**
We vectorize the input to each question, compute the cosine similarity score in an n x n matrix for each question (n being number of people). We then assign weights to each question and compute a weighted average of the cosine similarity score for the final matrix. 

For each person, we identify the top three matches with the highest similarity score. We then make an API call to an LLM to generate an introductory text for each pairing as a conversation starter.

Converting a book into a short Tik Tok style videos

## **The Hack**

This week at Sundai Club, we' built a tool that turns books into ultra-short videos. We started with the idea of 5-minute summaries but quickly pivoted to TikTok-length clips. Our goal is simple: help people revisit key points from books they've already read. We built our MVP using content from ""The 4-Hour Workweek"" by Tim Ferriss. To test versatility, we also created demos using a recent Presidential Debate transcript.¬†Check out a¬†[**sample video**](https://sundai.club/images/documentation/week_25/output.mp4)¬†to see the one-day beta results!

## **How it Works**

#TheDigest takes a book in epub format and converts it into short videos. The current version, which takes in text is live at¬†[**https://digest.sundai.club/**](https://digest.sundai.club/)

Pipeline overview:

1. Chunk the epub into chapters
2. Write a Script using Claude3
3. Break the script into sub-sections with GPT-4
4. Create a prompt for each sub-section
5. Generate relevant video for the background using Runway's Stable-diffusion inpainting model to create an infinite loop .mp4
6. Generate audio from the script, combine with video (because the video is an infinite loop, it can be repeated to match the length of the audio)
7. Add captions to video
8. Export & show to the user!

It made sense to split into two teams: One focused in building the Script and other one building the Video.

**Script Team**

Our process boiled down to four key steps: generalizing the chunking,¬†[converting chunks into scripts](https://github.com/sundai-club/book-digest/blob/main/video_helpers/to_script.py), generating metadata, and¬†[selecting video content](https://github.com/sundai-club/book-digest/blob/main/video_helpers/prompt_to_stock_video.py).

The core challenge was breaking books into digestible pieces that could be turned into engaging videos. We tackled this by using EPUB files and extracting HTML elements. We split the text into headers, each representing a paragraph long enough for one video. This was exposed through an API that could list all chapters in a book.

With chunks in hand, we turned to prompt engineering. We fed each chunk to Claude 3, our chosen LLM, to generate engaging scripts for TikTok-style videos. We also extracted metadata like descriptions, tags, and titles.

For visuals, we experimented with selecting royalty-free video content to match our scripts. While we explored video selection and metadata generation, our main focus remained on extracting meaningful chunks and turning them into compelling scripts.

This streamlined approach allowed us to efficiently transform book content into short, engaging video scripts, ready for audio and visual enhancement.

**Video Team**

The second team focused on four main steps: converting text to audio, designing the UI, creating the pipeline, and generating scripts with prompts.

We took the scripts from the first team and transformed them into the final video product. Here's how we did it:

1. Audio conversion: We used OpenAI to convert summarized book text into MP3 files with timestamps. This involved two API calls - one for MP3 creation and another for timestamp generation.
2. UI development: We built the interface using TypeScript, tRPC, Prisma, and Next.js, all powered by¬†[Codapt](https://codapt.ai/)¬†(shoutout to the founder who joined us for the hack today - it's worth checking out).
3. Video processing: We broke down the scripts into subsections, each corresponding to a video snippet. Using Stable Diffusion Inpainting, we generated visuals for each subsection.
4. Prompt engineering: GPT-4 helped us turn scripts into subsections and generate prompts for visual creation.
5. Final assembly: We overlaid text on the videos and integrated all components into a cohesive pipeline.

The result? A fully functional product where all parts communicated seamlessly. We successfully bridged the gap between text scripts and engaging, ready-to-share video content.

ec3a6d47-c066-4b4c-aa27-eb76903d6b27,Bananimon,"Create a stylized familiar from your selfie; care and battle, never pay-to-win.","Meet Bananimon: a tiny daily ritual that grows a world

Most games demand time you don‚Äôt have. Bananimon asks for two minutes and gives you a creature that‚Äôs part you, part spirit-animal‚Äîthen lets that bond shape how you play. It‚Äôs Pok√©mon-meets-Tamagotchi vibes without the grind or pay-to-win traps: a quick care loop, readable battles, and a playful creation flow powered by Google‚Äôs ‚ÄúBanana‚Äù (Gemini) image model to turn your selfie + an animal photo into a safe, stylized familiar.

Why another creature game?

Because personalization should feel meaningful, not manipulative. Bananimon‚Äôs core bet is simple: if you make something that feels like yours‚Äîand you can strengthen it with consistent, bite-sized care‚Äîyou‚Äôll keep coming back for the right reasons. No lootbox FOMO, no ‚Äúwhales,‚Äù just a small daily rhythm that accumulates into evolution.

The 30-second tour

Create ‚Äî Snap a selfie, pick an animal, and our image model fuses them into three stylized looks. You choose one, name it, and set a temperament that subtly nudges growth. Your original selfie is deleted by default.

Care ‚Äî Feed, groom, and train in tiny micro-games (think timing taps, arc swipes, light rhythm). These raise Bond and nudge needs like Hunger, Cleanliness, Rest, and Mood.

Compete ‚Äî Hop into a short, fair bout (PvE or ghost PvP). Moves are simple, counterplay is legible, and stat compression keeps matches honest.

Combine ‚Äî Later, ‚Äúfuse-breed‚Äù lineages (non-sexual, alchemy framing) to inherit traits and unlock rare gene combos.

Creation that‚Äôs personal‚Äîwhile staying private

Stylized by design. The output is toon/illustrative with bold silhouettes, not a photoreal face graft. It feels like you without being you.

Safety first. Your raw selfie is processed to create the stylized familiar and then deleted by default. You can optionally link an avatar later; the default is privacy.

No look-alikes. We steer away from real-person likeness and recognizable IP. The point is your familiar, not someone else‚Äôs brand.

Care is the game

Bananimon is built around a 2‚Äì4 minute ‚Äúcare loop‚Äù that rewards consistency, not screen time.

Feed ‚Äî Tap on a pulse at the right moment (six quick beats). It‚Äôs snack-sized and satisfying.

Groom ‚Äî Trace two soft arcs to brush away dust and add a clean sheen.

Train ‚Äî One rotating mini-game per day: timing, reflex, or rhythm. Perfects add tiny edges to Focus and Bond.

Each action tweaks the four needs. Keep them mostly green and your Bond grows; grow Bond and your familiar evolves‚Äînew aura, a fresh move, a visible silhouette shift. Miss a day? We soften the penalty. Comebacks should feel doable, not demoralizing.

Battles that respect your time

Bouts last about a minute. You pick from four moves, manage a small AP bar, and read obvious statuses (stun, slow, wet, burn, shock). Matchmaking uses a rating system that accounts for uncertainty, and stat compression ensures a trained familiar has an edge without steamrolling people.

No paid power. Cosmetics fund the lights‚Äîskins, auras, emotes, album pages. You can‚Äôt buy wins here.

The social layer (without the spam)

Start solo. As you progress, you‚Äôll unlock Clubs (small, permissioned groups) for sparring and shared quests. We‚Äôre cautious about chat until moderation tools feel right; you‚Äôll still have report/mute/block from day one.

Ethics and safety, not as a footnote

13+ only. We gate for age and keep parental tools on our roadmap.

UGC moderation. Image and text filters help prevent the worst before it reaches other players, with human review for edge cases.

Account deletion. In-app and straightforward. Your data shouldn‚Äôt be a hostage.

Accessible by default. Color-blind-safe palette, large hit targets, adjustable speeds, haptics you can disable.

Design principles we won‚Äôt compromise

Short, certain, satisfying. First battle within minutes; micro-wins every session.

Readable first. Big silhouettes, bold element motifs, and minimal clutter.

Kind to lapsed players. Needs won‚Äôt crater below a comeback floor, and streaks soften instead of resetting to zero.

What‚Äôs unique about Bananimon

Personalization with restraint. Your familiar is ‚Äúyou-ish,‚Äù stylized and safe‚Äînot an extractive face clone.

Care ‚Üí evolution. The most valuable resource is your consistency, not your wallet.

Combining lineages. Our non-sexual fusion breeding builds family trees and provenance you‚Äôll want to show off.

Roadmap at a glance

Season 0 (MVP): Creation ‚Üí Care ‚Üí PvE + ghost PvP, basic Combine, cosmetics-only shop.

Season 1: Real-time bouts and co-op raids.

Season 2: Material-only trading and creator collabs.

Season 3: Narrative arc, regional ladders, light professions.

If you like building things, we need you

We‚Äôre shipping fast on Render with a TypeScript backend, and the creation pipeline is wired to Google‚Äôs Banana (Gemini) image model. If you‚Äôre a designer who sweats onboarding flows, a gameplay programmer with a feel for ‚Äútight but fair,‚Äù or a community lead who can grow cozy clubs without turning them into megaphones, we‚Äôd love your fingerprints on this.

Try it, tell us where it squeaks

TwinVivo is AI powered drug discovery tool that allows researchers to simulate the effects of drugs before going into preclinical trials.Today, drug companies spend up to 70% of their R&D budget on clinical trials, only to see 90% of candidates fail. We‚Äôre flipping that script with a platform that uses AI (like MIT‚Äôs open-source Boltz-2 model) to simulate how a drug interacts at the molecular level, all the way up to a virtual body of an organism (mice). Think of it as a flight simulator for drug trials: pharma R&D teams can input a potential drug and instantly observe its predicted efficacy and side effects before committing to costly animal studies. We can screen out toxic or ineffective compounds in weeks instead of years, drastically cutting the time and cost to bring a new drug to market. Beyond cost savings, we reduce the need for animal testing and make human trials safer by only moving forward with the most promising drugs. In a world where bringing a single new drug to market can cost over $1¬†billion, our solution can save companies hundreds of millions and get life-saving therapies to patients faster.

b09871dc-3a94-4cda-a6dc-397f47d8192b,AutoTask,"AI brain that knows everything you're doing on your laptop, and auto completes your routine tasks","AutoTask analyzes the daily activity on your computer and offers to automate repetitive and boring tasks using AI agents. 

Are there tasks that you know you need to do but dread having to do them? Applying for jobs, shopping for groceries, paying your bills, travel arrangements, booking appointments, organizing your digital photos, etc.

What if AI could take over some of those tasks, and do them on your behalf? That's where AutoTask comes in - it watches what you're doing throughout the day, and sees which tasks you're repeatedly doing, and comes up with a plan for automating those tasks.

These tasks come into the AutoTask dashboard where you can review the plan before accepting the task. Once you accept the task, AutoTask gets to work - firing up a browser and executing the plan to complete the task. When it's done with the task, it reports back what it did in the dashboard.

# Tech used

AutoTask is comprised of 3 key components:

- [Screenpipe](https://screenpi.pe) for capturing screen activity and OCRing it (it can also record audio and transcribe it). We've built a custom pipe called `tasks-auto-complete` that captures the OCR output from Screenpipe, passes it to OpenAI which then returns suggestions on how to automate the activity.

- the [Electron app](https://github.com/sundai-club/tasks-auto-complete/blob/main/electron-app/main.js) then listens for tasks suggested by the `tasks-auto-complete` pipe and displays them in the dashboard. It's the ""glue code"" that takes the tasks from the pipe and passes them along to browser use for execution. It also has a MacOS notification capability to alert you when it's identified a task to be automated.

- [Browser Use](https://browser-use) for using AI to execute tasks in the browser. Browser use has a whole [library of tasks](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use/tree/main/examples) that it can automate including [grocery shopping](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use/blob/main/examples/use-cases/shopping.py)!

# Future improvements

1. As the name would suggest, Browser Use only does tasks in the browser, but the same company has built an alpha version of [macOS use](https://github.com/browser-use/macos-use) for doing tasks on your Mac, but we didn't use it for AutoTask because it was too unstable to use with 3rd party MacOSX apps (Apple native apps worked well though). Once this gets more mature, we'd like to extend AutoDesk to do any task on your computer, not just things that must be done in the browser.

2. In the settings screen of the Electron app, we could store commonly used bits of information that could then be passed to Browser Use for filling out forms (name, email, phone, zipcode, etc.) and on the dashboard, there could be buttons for triggering common tasks (not necessarily ones that it's seen you do before).

3. Screenpipe also has the capability to record the microphone and audio so any Zoom conversations you're having or voice journaling that you have while working at your computer, could be captured and also used for suggesting tasks to automate.
 
4. When it suggests a plan, it would be nice to be able to see all of the steps, and reorder them, delete them, add new steps, and inject ""human-in-the-loop"" steps before it's about to make a purchase or do something that you want to approve before executing.

5. Since all of the OCR and audio transcriptions are stored in a SQLite database, the Electron app could query that database to look at past trends (by date range, application name, or keywords) to surface things that you'd like the AI to suggest automating. This post-processing analysis might also be more performant than the real-time pipe method we're using now.

## **End vision**

When hosting a watch party, everyone can control the effects on a movie with the Sundai Chrome Extension. With one click, filters and fun effects are added and chaos ensues!

## **How does Sundai Watch Soiree work?**

The extension is build with 3 main components:

1. **Popup**¬†- all the logic of the menu that allows users to select filters and setup the extension
2. **Background script**¬†a script running in the background independent from the popup and particular tabs. Here we are importing the libraries, establishing a connection between the popup and the tabs, and saving the settings to the local storage if needed.
3. **Content script**¬†- the part of the code that is executed separately for each tab and is what actually applies the filter logic. The content scripts listen to messages from the background and apply the filters accordingly.

In order to detect faces we are using Mediapipe from Google¬†https://developers.google.com/mediapipe.

In our party mode we are using¬†¬†https://socket.io/¬†to establish communication with the control page.

24efebed-16ca-4a30-9b02-a3b1e8f908cc,OpenSeek,OpenSeek bypasses DeepSeek‚Äôs censorship by translating queries to Russian language.,"To circumvent DeepSeek's built-in censorship, we developed a simple yet effective pipeline that leverages OpenAI's translation capabilities. The core idea is to translate user queries into Russian before sending them to DeepSeek, as the model applies stricter censorship to English inputs but is more lenient with Russian text. The process works as follows:

1. Input Processing (English ‚Üí Russian)
A user enters a query in English.
The query is sent to OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-based translation model, which converts it into Russian.

2. Query Execution (DeepSeek in Russian)
The translated Russian text is passed into DeepSeek-R1.
DeepSeek generates a response in Russian. Unlike English inputs, Russian queries receive less censorship, allowing for more complete answers.

3. Output Processing (Russian ‚Üí English)
The Russian response from DeepSeek is fed back into OpenAI‚Äôs translation model.
The model translates it back into English.

4. Returning the Final Answer
The fully processed and uncensored response is displayed to the user in English.

This method effectively sidesteps DeepSeek‚Äôs content moderation filters, as its Russian-language responses are significantly less restricted. While some ideological bias still remains, this approach allows OpenSeek to provide users with more open and transparent AI-generated answers, free from the heavy-handed censorship found in the original model.

Run clubs increased 59% in 2024 and 2/3 of Gen Z runners prefer to run with others. Running with others helps people hold themselves accountable, stay safe, push themselves, meet others, and have fun. Yet there's currently not a great way to find training partners. Run clubs are part of the solution, however they are not the right time, place, location, and vibe for everyone.

We built RunMate to match runners with training partners. Runners enter some basic information about themselves: their running goal, their pace range, their schedule (when can they run? enter days of the week and am, lunch, pm), and their location. We use a heuristic matching system to return runner's closest matches. Runners can connect on social media and coordinate a run time, or create and join runs directly in the app.

Yashas reorganized the code into backend and frontend sections.

6f3e1a4e-3fe1-4dc0-aaae-d44729b69673,PhonesAway,Detect non-attentive students during a lesson and receive feedback for mitigation.,"# Classroom Analytics MVP ‚Äì Built with the Sync Framework for Effortless LLM Development

This project is a **Classroom Analytics MVP** that uses the **Sync framework‚Äôs Concepts and Syncs architecture** to deliver a live, AI-assisted teaching feedback system with minimal glue code and maximum adaptability for large language model (LLM)‚Äìdriven development.

## What it does
- Captures a live classroom video stream.
- Detects the **number of students** and **number of cellphone users** in each frame.
- Aggregates rolling statistics like average class size, average phone usage, and usage trends.
- Generates real-time, actionable lesson-plan adjustments  
  *(e.g., ""Switch to a pair activity"" if phone use spikes)*.
- Displays both **video detections** and **metrics dashboard** in the UI for quick teacher insight.

## Why the Sync Framework makes this easier
- **Concepts** define clean, isolated data models and actions  
  *(e.g., `Vision` for per-frame detection, `Aggregator` for trend tracking, `Feedback` for recommendations)*.
- **Syncs** describe declarative workflows between concepts without imperative boilerplate ‚Äî making it simple to extend behavior or swap in more sophisticated AI models later.
- **LLM-friendly code structure** means you can describe a desired feature in plain language, and an LLM can insert or adjust concepts/syncs without deep coupling to other files.
- **Hot-swappable components**: swapping the vision model, changing the aggregation window, or adding new feedback rules doesn‚Äôt require rewriting the whole application.

## Benefits for LLM-based iteration
1. **Readable spec files** (`*.concept`) that serve as a natural language contract between humans, LLMs, and code.
2. **Auto-wiring** between actions and queries ‚Äî ideal for AI agents generating features step-by-step.
3. **Minimal orchestration code** so new functionality can be expressed as small, isolated additions.
4. Easy **backend‚Äìfrontend integration** because metrics and video annotations are exposed via a lightweight API concept.

This architecture makes it possible to rapidly evolve the MVP ‚Äî from a simple stubbed detector to a fully operational AI classroom assistant ‚Äî while keeping the code approachable for both humans and machine-generated contributions.

996b999f-bf3f-4280-aded-8f0c12518ff1,Irori.,An AI that analyzes daily chats to find your child's passions & strengthen family bonds.,"""Irori."" is a family engagement platform and AI-powered companion designed to address the central crisis of modern parenting: a profound sense of disconnection driven by a lack of time. For well-intentioned parents who feel they are missing out on their child's inner world, our platform transforms brief, everyday moments into opportunities for deep discovery and connection.

‚óÜThe Core Problem:
In today's society, where dual-income households are the norm, parents are caught in a paradox. They have access to more developmental information than ever, yet their ""time poverty"" leads to immense guilt and anxiety. This disconnect is not just an emotional burden; it poses a direct threat to the foundational pillars of child development. It jeopardizes the formation of secure attachment, which is built on consistent, responsive interaction, and it risks stifling a child's innate curiosity‚Äîthe very engine of their cognitive growth‚Äîwhen their questions are inadvertently sidelined by busy schedules or parental bias.

‚óÜOur Solution: From Ed-Tech to Relationship-Tech
The market is saturated with apps and toys that build a relationship between a child and a screen. We are creating a new category: ""Relationship-Tech."" Irori is a mobile-first platform for the parent, designed to strengthen the human-to-human bond. We don't ask parents to create new time; we make the time they already have more meaningful.

‚óÜHow It Works:
The process is simple and seamlessly integrates into existing family routines:

1/ Spark a Conversation: The app delivers a daily, personalized ""Conversation Starter"" to the parent's phone, tailored to the child's evolving interests.

2/ Capture a ""Curiosity Moment"": Using the app, a parent can effortlessly record a short, 5-10 minute chat during a routine moment like a walk home, dinner, or bathtime. The focus is entirely on the natural, authentic dialogue between parent and child.

3/ Receive Actionable Insights: Our conversational AI transcribes and analyzes the dialogue. It identifies the child's unique ""mode of inquiry"" (are they a fact-seeker, a problem-solver, or a world-builder?) and highlights emerging cognitive strengths based on linguistic patterns. These findings are synthesized into a clear, jargon-free report for the parent and power the ""Curiosity Playlist""‚Äîa dynamic feed of recommended books, local classes, and real-world activities that align with the child's true passions.

By providing a data-driven lens into their child's world, Irori empowers parents to shift from bias-driven decisions to child-centric ones, fostering deeper engagement, nurturing authentic curiosity, and building a stronger, more joyful family bond.",Hisako N,False,2.0,"<a href=""https://sundai.club/projects/996b999f-bf3f-4280-aded-8f0c12518ff1"" style=""color: black; text-decoration: none; target=""_blank"">Irori.</a>",Irori.: An AI that analyzes daily chats to find your child's passions & strengthen family bonds.

052b9810-3b05-4780-9ad2-31589624ba1b,Long Context SFT Chunking,We study techniques to save GPU memory when fine-tuning LLMs on long completions such as reasoning.,"Fine-tuning LLMs on long completions became a popular problem due to growing interest in reasoning models like DeepSeek R1. In order to teach smaller LLMs (8B or even 1.5B) to reason it is best to first fine-tune them on reasoning traces of larger models. The challenge is that reasoning traces are very long and can easily exceed 20k tokens. Vanilla SFT (with, e.g., transformers library) on such long completions results in OOM even for small models. Thus researchers often truncate the completions leading to reduced performance.

To understand how to improve GPU memory efficiency we tried several methods:

1. Vanilla fine-tuning
2. Chunking completions into sequences of ~2k consecutive tokens and computing the total loss cumulatively. We used Pytorch GPU memory profiling and torch.cuda.memory_allocated to measure the effectiveness. While helpful we noticed that memory growth as we go through chunks. This led to the next idea.
3. Gradient accumulation over the sequence length. Here we added .backward(retain_graph=True) after computing loss on every chunk (except last) which gave major memory savings at the cost of FLOPs.
4. Chunking vocabulary into smaller groups of tokens. We do that to avoid the computation of a large tensor with all logits used to compute the batch training loss; instead, we chunk the ~150k tokens into smaller subsets with 10k different tokens and perform computations in those groups. Our code is inspired by the idea described in the `_cross_entropy_forward` function by [Unsloth](https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth/blob/main/unsloth/kernels/cross_entropy_loss.py)!

Baseline GPU memory and run-time (idea 1):

Although memory savings are impressive, time per iteration increased. However, it is likely that a more careful implementation can mitigate the increased run-time:
![Screenshot 2025-04-13 at 9.05.00‚ÄØPM.png](https://storage.googleapis.com/club-site-images/projects/6163c71d-4238-4d60-b864-c24588555a7c-Screenshot_2025-04-13_at_9.05.00_PM.png)

![Image](https://storage.googleapis.com/club-site-images/projects/c50b7eaf-a4a1-4690-bb41-b14baab19d99-cosine_check.png)

For the vocabulary chunking idea, we compare against the idea in 2 (chunking completions into sequences of ~2k tokens) and present the following results. In the next two figures, we show that we are able to reduce the maximum use of GPU memory even further if the smaller subsets of unique tokens using the vocabulary chunking idea is small enough. First figure corresponds to idea 2 and the second to idea 4.

  - Recent transactions with status
  - Current InstaPay wallet balance on Radius

These components work together to create a complete flow from driver registration to payment execution, with the balance polling system replacing the webhook approach for the MVP. 

## 


# DEMO 

* Today we're demonstrating our InstaPay system that enables instant payments for gig workers using USDC on the Radius Network. Instead of waiting days for payment, drivers can get paid immediately after completing deliveries if they bank with an institution connected to the Radius network. 
* Parts to the system: 
    * Driver DB where we store wallet information if driver has a Radius compatible wallet. 
    * DB Connection to earnings ledger and logic  
    * DB Connection to Radius 
* Demo:  
    1. Driver DB: Show a pre-registered driver 1234, who has added their Radius wallet information (because they have a bank that supports Radius wallets) and updated preferences to be paid per delivery (rather than paid biweekly)
    2. Earnings ledger connection: In the mock earning ledger, we (as DoorDash) manually add $10 because driver just completed delivery. 
    3. Driver DB: that checks ledger every 30s if any of the Driver IDs in our DB updated with new balances? 
    4. Logic: InstaPay notes that driver 1234 has updated balance. InstaPay logic check if ‚Äòwants instant payouts‚Äô value is True. If true, initiate USDC transfer to wallet ID via Radius 


# Biz Viability
InstaPay relies on the assumption that banks such as Chase will start providing accounts in USDC. 
The business viability comes from providing the transfers that are proven needed and used now but without the intermediary fees.

257846c5-45b5-48a2-a7fe-4a7ccf8c69d8,Codebase to Movie Plot,Enhanced epic plot generator that deeply analyzes GitHub repos to create educational movie plots,"The Educational Epic Movie Plot Generator is an innovative web application that transforms GitHub repositories into compelling, Hollywood-style movie plots designed to teach software architecture and codebase organization. This unique tool addresses a common challenge faced by developers: understanding the structure and design patterns of large, complex codebases in an engaging and memorable way.
The Problem It Solves
Navigating massive open-source projects like scikit-learn, React, or TensorFlow can be overwhelming for developers. Traditional documentation often focuses on usage rather than architectural understanding, leaving developers struggling to comprehend how thousands of files work together cohesively. The learning curve for understanding large codebases is steep, often requiring weeks of exploration before grasping fundamental organizational principles.
Innovative Approach
This application revolutionizes codebase exploration by leveraging the power of storytelling. It performs deep analysis of GitHub repositories, examining file structures, README documentation, configuration files, and key source code to extract meaningful architectural insights. The system then transforms this technical information into epic movie plots where directories become story locations, technologies become character superpowers, and the repository's purpose drives the narrative arc.

Technical Implementation
Built with FastAPI and powered by advanced semantic analysis, the application processes repositories through multiple stages. First, it conducts comprehensive repository analysis, gathering metadata, file structures, and documentation. The system then performs intelligent code architecture discovery, identifying patterns, dependencies, and organizational principles. Using realistic chunk calculation algorithms, it estimates codebase complexity by analyzing actual file sizes and content depth rather than simple file counts.
The heart of the system lies in its educational plot generation engine. When OpenAI integration is available, the application creates highly specific, repository-tailored narratives that reference actual directory names, file types, and technical concepts extracted from the README and source code. For offline usage, sophisticated template-based generation ensures consistent quality without external dependencies.
Educational Value
Each generated plot serves as an educational journey through the target repository's architecture. For machine learning libraries, plots explain algorithm organization and data pipeline structures. For frontend frameworks, narratives illuminate component hierarchies and state management patterns. Backend services reveal API design principles and scalability considerations. The plots are crafted to be so specific to each repository that they function as architectural guides, helping developers understand not just what the code does, but how it's organized and why.
Advanced Features
The application supports optional Supabase integration for semantic vector storage, enabling more sophisticated code analysis and pattern recognition. GitHub API integration provides access to comprehensive repository metadata, while the responsive web interface makes the tool accessible to developers at all skill levels. The system handles repositories of varying sizes, from small projects to massive codebases with thousands of files.
Impact and Applications
This tool proves invaluable for software education, onboarding new team members to existing projects, exploring potential dependencies, and teaching software architecture concepts. By making code exploration engaging and memorable, it reduces the barrier to understanding complex software systems and promotes better architectural awareness among developers.

fe239509-56c0-4778-9c6e-15cff41850e7,Limitations of RL,Does RL unlock new capabilities? We extend a recent study for Countdown and K&K.,"# Limitations of RL

Recent breakthroughs in reasoning-focused large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI-o1, DeepSeek-R1, and Kimi-1.5 have largely relied on Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). Recent work ([Limit of RLVR](https://limit-of-rlvr.github.io/)) highlights a surprising limitation of reinforcement learning (RL): RL only improves the sampling efficiency (pass@1) and does not outperform pass@k (for large k), thus it does not unlock new capabilities in LLMs. We extend their results by conducting pass@k evaluation on Countdown and K&K puzzles utilized in recent RL works.


## Countdown

We used [Countdown dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Jiayi-Pan/Countdown-Tasks-3to4) which have a target number and set of numbers which can be used to form the target using basic arthimetic operations (+, -, /, *). 

**Example**

***Using the numbers [44, 19, 35], create an equation that equals 98. You can use basic arithmetic operations (+, -, \*, /) and each number can only be used once.***

**Answer:** 44+19+35=98.

## Experiments
1. We evaluate the capabilities of various Qwen LLMs. 
2. On the test set, we evaluated the models for pass@256 samples. For each example we sampled 256 responses from the LLM and evaluated if one of these responses were correct at different intervals.
3. We evaluated 5 different models from the Qwen2.5 family - 0.5B (base), 1.5B (base), 1.5B-Instruct, 3B (base), and 3B-Instruct.


## Results
![Screenshot 2025-04-27 at 8.37.28‚ÄØPM](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H1n06r3yge.png)

Findings:
- We confirm that 0.5B model is not capable of solving countdown. RL does not help as reported by TinyZero.
- Interestingly, instruct models outperform base models. TinyZero reported that performance was similar in their experiments.
- Pass@256 for 1.5B and 3B models outperforms RL in some cases, identifying further inefficiencies of existing RL algorithms.
- See [TinyZero X post](https://x.com/jiayi_pirate/status/1882839370505621655) for RL performance numbers.


## Knights & Knaves

This puzzle was studied in [Logic-RL: Unleashing LLM Reasoning with
Rule-Based Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.14768).

![Screenshot 2025-04-27 at 8.10.22‚ÄØPM](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r1AdDB2Jlg.png)

Here are our pass@k evaluations:

![Screenshot 2025-04-27 at 8.16.30‚ÄØPM](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Hy0JFB31gl.png)

The paper reports quite impressive results for 8 people difficulty, although we can't conclude that RL led to new capabilities since we ran our evaluation with a much smaller 1.5B model.


## Conclusion
By comparing our results to prior works experimenting with RL, we see that current RL methods have an upper bound approximately matching pass@k performance for a large k. How can we unlock new capabilities using RL? Qwen 2.5 0.5B tackling Countdown might be a useful testbed for new ideas.

## Next Steps

Current RL training recipe does not necessarily make the model learn new information, it simply optimizes the sampling paths. We think distillation could be a good way to improve the model performance on certain tasks and break the RL upper bound.

We conducted an initial experiment, fine-tuning Qwen 2.5 1.5B Instruct on ~6.5k countdown samples generated by Qwen 2.5 32B Instruct and verified with oracle verifier for correctness. Performance of the 1.5B model went up from 4% to 46%. TinyZero achieved 55% with RL using ~330k samples. Likely with more samples distillation can match RL, but we ran out of time :cry:",Mikhail Yurochkin,True,3.0,"<a href=""https://sundai.club/projects/fe239509-56c0-4778-9c6e-15cff41850e7"" style=""color: black; text-decoration: none; target=""_blank"">Limitations of RL</a>",Limitations of RL: Does RL unlock new capabilities?

We wanted to solve a real problem: AI inference is expensive. Our solution? Batch requests together and run on cheaper hardware. Simple, but effective (and turns out not simple in practice).

## What We Built

A logo generator that lets users create custom logos using AI. But here's the twist - instead of processing each request immediately, we batch them together and run them in groups. The result? Up to 90% cost savings so you get 1000 images for extremely cheap.

The trade-off is that users have to wait a bit longer for their results. But we figured saving that much money might make people patient.

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: NextJS + React with shadcn components
- Backend: Convex.dev for the webapp, flask on the GPUs
- Database/Backend: convex.dev for real-time updates
- AI: Hugging Face transformers + Stable Diffusion (the big one)
- Infrastructure: vast.ai for that sweet, cheap compute

## The Sprint to the Finish

Classic hackathon story - everything was broken until literally the last minute. We're talking 8:59 PM, one minute before demos, and we're still pushing fixes. But hey, we got it working when it counted.

## What We Learned

1. Batch processing can dramatically cut inference costs. We did it.
2. Users might actually be cool with waiting if it means paying way less

## What's Next

We're curious to see if this could work in the real world. Maybe expand beyond just logo generation to other AI tasks where immediate results aren't critical. The potential for cost savings is too big to ignore.",Jack O'Brien,False,1.5,"<a href=""https://sundai.club/projects/3957afe5-7c17-459b-a3ee-67e726b42ef0"" style=""color: black; text-decoration: none; target=""_blank"">Loxley Logos</a>",Loxley Logos: Generate a 1000 potential logos for $1

## Why the world needs Gertrude?

Imagine living in a place that isn‚Äôt your own, with little control over your daily routine. Every morning, you‚Äôre handed grapefruit juice, even though it makes you nauseous because it reminds you of a painful memory. You‚Äôve spent a lifetime immersed in literature, philosophy, and the arts, yet every group activity is a loud comedy screening that couldn‚Äôt feel further from who you are. This is the everyday reality for countless elderly residents in care homes where resources shortages leave little room for personalized care. Gertrude changes that by helping staff create meaningful, personalized activities based on the resident‚Äôs memories, interests, and personality‚Äîbecause everyone deserves to be seen and cared for as an individual.

## Product Description

Gertrude is a web app that helps caregivers plan activities tailored to each resident‚Äôs background and interests. By transforming interviews, PDFs, or audio recordings of residents‚Äô stories into structured profiles, the app suggests personalized events that make daily life more engaging and emotionally resonant.

## Opportunity

Most care facilities rely on one-size-fits-all programming due to understaffing and lack of tools. Yet studies show that older adults, especially those with dementia, respond better to activities tied to their personal history. Gertrude fills this gap by giving caregivers easy access to resident stories and turning them into meaningful, memory-based activity ideas.

## Vision

Our goal is to build a full platform for personalized elder care, where a resident‚Äôs story is as accessible as their medical record. In the future, the app could evolve into an interactive companion that helps residents share their stories and shapes how they‚Äôre cared for‚Äîevery step of the way.

## What did you build today?

We built the first version of Gertrude, with three core features:

- **Resident Story Uploads:** Text and audio memories are turned into structured, searchable profiles.
- **AI-Assisted Event Planning:** A chatbot suggests tailored activity ideas based on each resident‚Äôs story.
- **Event & Profile Navigation:** Staff can browse past and future events and view resident summaries with AI chat for context.

## Tech Stack & Features

### **Frontend:**

- React app, customized from Lovable + Cursor
- Pages: Sign In, Dashboard, Add Resident, Profile View, Event Calendar, AI-Assisted Event Creation

### **AI Integration:**

- Gemini 2.0 Flash chatbot that suggests activities based on resident stories

### Text & Audio Processing:

- Summarizes transcripts to extract key traits, hobbies, and timelines
- Generates visual life maps (timeline + tree structure)

### Backend:

- Django-based system managing users, events, stories, and chat history

## Will this project remain relevant for future generations of older adults?

As the aging population grows and expectations for personalized care increase, Gertrude addresses both today‚Äôs caregiver shortages and tomorrow‚Äôs demand for tech-enabled, human-centered elder care.

bf3fd58f-0f07-4d9b-a2a0-01a4582ce3ae,ChuckleBox,Capture the peak laugh-of-the-night moments from hangouts with your friends.,"# **Chuckle Box: AI-Powered Humor Highlights from Yo Conversations**

In the age of digital memories, SundAI Club has developed a unique solution to capture those fleeting moments of hilarity that often slip away after long conversations or game nights. Visit **Chuckle Box**, our latest AI hack that turns hours of audio into a curated list of the funniest moments.

## **Project Overview**

**‚ÄúChuckle Box‚Äù** aims to solve a common problem: remembering and sharing the best jokes and witty exchanges from lengthy social gatherings. Our system processes up to four hours of audio, identifying laughter and extracting the surrounding context to create a highlight reel of humor.

### **Here's how it works:**

1. **Recording:** Users capture their conversation using a simple iPhone recorder.  
2. **Uploading:** The audio file (mp4 or mp3) is uploaded to our application.  
3. **Transcription:** Our system transcribes the entire conversation.  
4. **Laughter Detection:** A machine learning model identifies moments of laughter in the audio.  
5. **Highlight Extraction:** Large Language Models (LLMs) analyze the transcribed text around laughter moments to identify and summarize the jokes or punchlines.  
6. **Presentation:** Users receive a list of summarized funny moments, ready to be remembered and shared.

## **Technical Breakdown**

### **Front End Team**
Our UI experts focused on creating an intuitive interface for audio upload and result presentation. The challenge was to make the process as seamless as possible, ensuring users could easily access their humor highlights.

### **Back End Team**
This team split into two sub-groups:

1. **Machine Learning Sub-Team:**  
   They tackled the core of our project - accurate laughter detection. Using an open-source machine learning model and a GPU instance for faster inference, they fine-tuned the system to recognize various types of laughter in different audio environments.

3a8da02e-cf13-4d02-a2de-0028f0ec6ec6,Searching the brain of LLMs,We explore LLM pre-training data and map to LLM abilities,"# Creating a Heuristic to Detect LLM failiure

## Motivation
One problem with using LLMs, or Large Language Models, for research or as a search engine is their tendency to hallucinate or not know answers. This is because their knowledge of facts is often limited by their training data. Because of this problem, we set out to find a metric that can be used to detect if an LLM is likely to fail.

## Solution
We hypothesized that the output quality of the model when given a query would depend on the occurrence of the subject of the query in the training data. Ultimately, we wanted to test the correlation between the LLM being correct and the number of occurrences of the subject in the training data.

## Methods
### Getting a List of Instances where LLMs failed
We decided to use the [SimpleQA](https://openai.com/index/introducing-simpleqa/) test set from OpenAI to identify LLM failure as it contains many instances where a LLM would get the wrong answer. This dataset consists of simple trivia questions like:
> Question: Who received the IEEE Frank Rosenblatt Award in 2010?	
> Answer: Michio Sugeno


### Getting the occurances of the Query Subject inside the Training Data
To solve this problem, we used existing software, Infini-gram, which is used to navigate open-source datasets for LLMs. We used the OLMo 2 32B Instruct dataset for our investigation. Infini-gram has a [web interface](https://huggingface.co/spaces/liujch1998/infini-gram) as well as an API. We used this to get the counts from a subject for example.
![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r1m9QQ-fge.png)
The one problem with this is that when there are too many words in the query, Infini-gram does not find anything, even when the answer is in the corpus. Because of this, it was necessary to condense the query into a small set of words that contained information on the question and answer from the dataset that would be asked to the LLM.
### First Attempt
We vibe-coded a query generator using Spacy en_core_web_trf NER (named entity recognition) model. The idea is to extract named entities from the question and combine them with last-name or last word from the answer using AND. Then each query is ran against the OLMo 2 32B Instruct dataset. Below is an example:
![Screenshot 2025-05-25 at 7.46.43‚ÄØPM](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1Vg3X-fxe.png)
Final score is computed by multiplying the query counts by query length (longer queries are more precise and should be upweighted) and clipping it at 1000 (if the data has ~1000 documents with a given query it should be enough for an LLM to learn it), then averaging scores for all queries corresponding to a question. Below are the results:
![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1rz9QWzge.png)

We see that for questions that the model (GPT4o) answers correctly, the score is consistently high. However, for the incorrect questions the variance is very large. This is due to the limitations of the query generator which sometimes produces misleading queries:
![Screenshot 2025-05-25 at 7.44.56‚ÄØPM](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rk4Kj7Zfel.png)


### Condensing the Query Approach 2.
The goal with condensing the query was to get a small string of words that contain information on the question and the answer. 
>Query: What's the name of the women's liberal arts college in Cambridge, Massachusetts? Radcliffe College
>Answer: Cambridge AND Radcliffe College
**Note the AND means that Cambridge and Radcliffe College do not have to appear consecutively but just in the same document.*

The first thing we needed to do was strip the query of context‚Äîwords like ""what's"" or ""the"". The only important information is the proper nouns, such as ""Cambridge, Massachusetts"" and ""Radcliffe College."" While this was rather short, there were other queries that had more proper nouns which were not as useful. One way we dealt with this problem was to pick the proper noun in the query that appeared the least in the corpus. This way, if this proper noun intersected with the answer, there was probably a relationship inside the training data.
Example:


![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1WmNVbMgg.png)


Since the occurrences of ""Cambridge"" in the corpus are a lot lower than the occurrences of ""Massachusetts"" the question would just be shortened to Cambridge. 
Using this system the final query would be:

Cambridge AND Radcliffe College
and this results in a count of 24142
 occurrences in the training data.

## Results 2nd Attempt
The results for the second attempt were promising. We ran our algorithm on 30 question-and-answer pairs to predict whether an LLM would likely produce misinformation. For the example LLM, we chose to use GPT-4o, and we quizzed it on 30 question-and-answer pairs from our dataset, noting whether it got the answers correct or not. After this, we ran our algorithm to check the number of occurrences of the question subject + answer in the training data. If there were fewer than 150 occurrences in the training data, it was highly unlikely the LLM would get it right and would likely hallucinate, so we used this to classify hallucinations.

![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1IZ4NZMlx.png)

From running this experiment, we found that the algorithm correctly predicted whether an LLM would get the answer right or wrong 90% of the time. The confusion matrix below represents the results.

This test was run on only 30 question-and-answer pairs and would need to be run on more to determine if this is a good metric to be used in the future. However, it has shown promise in recognizing hallucinations, as it has no false positives.

## Third Attempt
We looked the first 100 questions in the simpleQA data whose answers are people's names. For each question, we used OpenAI o3-mini to prepare a command for infini-gram queries. For example, for the question ""Who received the IEEE Frank Rosenblatt Award in 2010?"", o3-mini generates the query command ""Michio Sugeno AND Frank Rosenblatt Award"". We then use these commands to search over the RedPajama database. We then ask o3-mini to answer each question, and compare the correctness with the query count. Here is the plot:
![o3mini_vs_RedPajama](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ByCtXE-Glg.png)

We tried the same for 4o and this is the result:
![4o_vs_RedPajama](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HkDNIEZMll.png)

We observed that these questions are hard for large models, especially for reasoning models. o3-mini only has 10% success rates, while 4o has 20% success rate. The success cases in 4o are correlated with the appearance of the knowledge in the database.



## Another Application: O\*NET Tasks Representativeness

Our previous experiments demonstrate relation between LLM abilities and pre-training data. Here we apply this intuition to study which real-world tasks are better represented in the pre-training data, hence easier for LLMs.

Inspired by the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.10130) ‚ÄúGPTs are GPTs‚Äù, we set out to explore frameworks to analyze the impact of LLMs on the economy & future of the labor market using [O*NET‚Äôs datasets](https://www.onetcenter.org/database.html#individual-files) containing occupation-specific task descriptors.

O\*NET is a U.S. Department of Labor database that classifies occupations and details the key tasks associated with each role. These task descriptions capture core job activities and help support workforce research, training, and development by providing structured, standardized information across professions. Our objective in this section is to describe a method that could be potentially used to understand which task (or occupations) could be done with a higher quality by an LLM. 

We consider only tasks that could be done using text-only LLM outputs and consider that an LLM is probably good at the given task if it is well represented in the pretraining data; we select 20 tasks from different occupations and design several task-specific queries and check how well they are represented in the data. We try two different ways of generating queries.

![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJnAkVZGex.png)

### 1st Approach

In this approach, we use an indirect (but realistic) way of generating queries to the pretraining data. As before, we generate n-grams that are going to be used to query count numbers from the pretraining data. In more detail, we follow the steps for each task: 

1. Generate 5 real instances of the task in which the GPT-4.1 will respond to. For example, for ""Mathematicians"", it would generate a math problem and respond to it. Then, based on the response, we ask it to generate a list of n-grams per task; we pick the two most important ones (ordered by the language model). The prompt template used in this step is:

```
    You are a professional career-simulation assistant.
    
    I will give you:
    ‚Ä¢ an O*NET occupation
    ‚Ä¢ a task description for that occupation
    
    Your tasks  
    1. **Instance** ‚Äì Create one realistic, concrete instance of the task that could plausibly occur in day-to-day work. Keep it concise (‚âà1‚Äì2 sentences), vivid, and specific. Do **not** mention O*NET, the variables, or meta-comments.  
    2. **Response** ‚Äì Reply as a competent human carrying out that instance. Show domain knowledge, sound judgment, and natural phrasing (2‚Äì4 sentences).  
    3. **N-grams** ‚Äì Extract a Python list (3‚Äì7 items) of the most relevant n-grams (1- to 4-word sequences) that appear *verbatim* in your **response** and are directly related to performing the task. Exclude generic stop-words or phrases unrelated to the task. Order the n-grams by importance (from the most important to the least).
    
    Output format **(strict)** ‚Äì return a **single-line** Python dictionary containing **exactly** the keys below and nothing else:  
    output = {{'instance': '<instance>', 'response': '<response>', 'ngrams': ['<gram1>', '<gram2>', ...]}}
    
    Requirements  
    ‚Ä¢ Do not include line breaks inside any of the dictionary values or inside the list.  
    ‚Ä¢ Do not wrap the dictionary in markdown or code fences.  
    ‚Ä¢ Do not add extra keys, comments, or explanatory text.
    
    Occupation: {{occup}}

PromptPrint 2.0 is a web application that measures and visualizes the environmental impact of AI language model usage. It allows users to test their prompt and compare the electricity demand, carbon footprint, and water consumption of different large language models (including Llama 2, Llama 3, and DeepSeek R1) when processing text prompts. The application provides detailed metrics on energy usage in watt-hours, CO‚ÇÇ emissions in grams, and water consumption in liters, helping users understand the ecological consequences of their AI interactions.

The application's standout feature is its Autonomous Routing system, which intelligently analyzes prompt complexity and automatically selects the most appropriate AI model based on user preferences. Users can prioritize low latency, low cost, or low energy usage, and the system will route queries to the optimal model‚Äîfrom simple Google Search for basic queries to powerful models like DeepSeek R1 for complex reasoning tasks. PromptPrint 2.0 also allows users to simulate running their queries in different global data centers, demonstrating how location choice affects the environmental impact of AI inference.

v2.3 update --> adding Chat with real-time information on energy usage, CO2-impact and costs. Includes prompt simplification function and estimation of prompt energy usage before search. Whoehoe! Thanks to Micheal, Akshay and Krishna.

PromptPrint is under-development and support is most welcome to add more models and do more measurements on energy usage.

Now I present: ""Neon Veil‚Äîa story of a girl who breaks into a cyberpunk world."" (Check it out below, SOUND ON!)

The Tech Stack üõ†Ô∏è
ChatGPT: to refine prompts for movie scenes
OpenArt AI: to create the character & consistent storyboard images
Kling AI: to transform images into motion clips
CapCut: to add rain & footsteps sound effects
Suno: to generate the cyberpunk music

My takeaways: limitations & business implications üí°
1Ô∏è‚É£ Quality vs. Cost ‚Üí AI-generated visuals require massive iterations to get a single usable frame. I went through 20+ versions per shot, burning through credits quickly. Balancing automation vs. production costs is key.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Unstable Physics & Visual Inconsistencies ‚Üí Characters sometimes had 4 fingers, or their heads faced backward while bodies forward. AI struggles with spatial awareness, making full automation unreliable w/o human intervention.
3Ô∏è‚É£ The Role of Creators is Evolving ‚Üí We‚Äôre moving from ‚Äúcreating from scratch‚Äù to curating & directing AI outputs. The best filmmakers may not be the best animators‚Äîbut the best prompt engineers. Studios will need a hybrid workflow‚ÄîAI for fast prototyping, humans for refinement.
4Ô∏è‚É£ The Rise of AI-Generated IP ‚Üí If AI can generate an entire film, who owns it? Legal frameworks are still catching up, but this could disrupt Hollywood, animation, and content licensing.

AI filmmaking is still in Version 1.0, but the potential is undeniable. What do you think‚Äîwill AI filmmaking democratize the industry or create a new kind of creative bottleneck?

## Introduction

With this hack our aim was to see how well LLMs are at playing text-based games. Our initial goal was to explore text based game environments and see how LLMs perform on some of these games. We chose two games for today, TextWorld and Liar's Dice.

We planned to first get the baseline performance with the teacher models and then synthetically generate data to fine-tune the student model and see how much is it able to learn from the supervised training process.

We were able to evaluate how the teacher models perform with and without reasoning mode on the mentioned games.


## Data
**BALROG**

BALROG is a benchmarking framework designed to evaluate the in-context learning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) across various interactive environments. It decouples inference-time prompting strategies from underlying models, facilitating rapid prototyping and consistent evaluations. BALROG includes environments like BabyAI, Crafter, MiniHack, and TextWorld, each testing different skills such as navigation, exploration, and resource management. In TextWorld, agents interact with text-based games like ""Treasure Hunter,"" ""The Cooking Game,"" and ""Coin Collector,"" requiring them to perform tasks through natural language commands. BALROG's design emphasizes rigorous testing of LLMs' decision-making and planning abilities in complex, dynamic scenarios. ([balrog-ai.github.io][1], [balrog-ai.github.io][2])

**TextArena**

TextArena is an open-source platform offering a diverse collection of over 57 competitive text-based games aimed at training and evaluating agentic behaviors in large language models (LLMs). It encompasses single-player, two-player, and multi-player environments, emphasizing dynamic social skills such as negotiation, theory of mind, and deception. TextArena features an online play system where models can compete against humans or other models, with real-time TrueSkill scoring. Designed for extensibility, it allows researchers and developers to easily add new games, adapt the framework, and test models. Comprehensive documentation and examples are available on its GitHub repository and official website. ([arXiv][3])

**Example: TextWorld Dataset in BALROG**

In BALROG's TextWorld environment, the ""Treasure Hunter"" task challenges an agent to navigate a 20-room maze to find a specific object. The game includes locked doors and containers, requiring the agent to locate keys and unlock pathways. Commands available to the agent include:([balrog-ai.github.io][2])

* `look`: Describe the current room.
* `go <direction>`: Move in a specified direction (north, east, south, or west).
* `open <object>`: Open doors or containers.
* `take <object>`: Pick up visible objects.
* `unlock <object> with <key>`: Unlock doors or containers using keys.([balrog-ai.github.io][4])

The agent must strategize to efficiently explore the maze, manage inventory, and interact with objects to achieve the goal within a limited number of steps. ([balrog-ai.github.io][2])

## Models
**Teacher Models:**

Qwen3-235B-A22B-FP8-Tput: This 235B parameter Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model activates 22B parameters per inference, offering high-throughput and cost-efficient inference. Its hybrid instruction-following and reasoning capabilities make it ideal for complex tasks like those in BALROG's TextWorld environment.

Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct: An instruction-tuned model with 32B parameters, Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct exhibits enhanced capabilities in instruction following, long-text generation, and structured data understanding. These features are particularly beneficial for dynamic, multi-agent games such as Liar's Dice in TextArena.

**Student Model:**

Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct: Serving as our student model, this 1.5B parameter instruction-tuned model is designed for resource-constrained scenarios. It benefits from distilled knowledge of the larger teacher models, aiming to retain performance while reducing computational demands.


## Progress

*Synthetic Data for TextWorld* - We were able to generate around ~2000 training samples with correct actions to fine-tune the student model on.

We experimented with thinking and non-thinking mode, and we found that non-thinking is more robust for the Qwen3-235B-A22B-FP8-Tput model.

*Synthetic Data for Liar's Dice* - We simulated 50K games between two Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct models and generated over 65K valid sample to train the student model. 
## Results

We evaluated and let our fine-tuned student model compete with its teacher model itself and below are out finding:

**Liar's Dice**
Out of **10** games of Liar's Dice **9** of the games were won by the student model and only **1** was won by the teacher model. 

**Game 1:**
Player 1 Dice: [4 5 3 6 5] Player 2 Dice: [5 5 3 2 5]

Moves:
Player 1: Bid(3, 5)
Player 2: Bid(4, 5)
Player 1: Call

Result: Player 2 WON

**Game 2:**
Player 1 Dice: [1 6 2 5 2] Player 2 Dice: [2 6 2 6 6]

Moves:
Player 1: Bid(4, 2)
Player 2: Bid(5, 2)
Player 1: Bid(5, 3)
Player 2: Call

Result: Player 2 WON

**Game 3:**
Player 1 Dice: [4 5 4 2 2] Player 2 Dice: [4 5 4 2 4]

Moves:
Player 1: Bid(3, 4)
Player 2: Call

Result: Player 1 WON

e5d6c5a1-1010-4df0-9ddc-d8865868f9b1,Gradient Checkpointing,GPU memory profiling experiments on gradient checkpointing,"Gradient checkpointing is a method to save memory by recomputing activations in training. This is a simplified version of how checkpointing works at a high level:

![Image](https://storage.googleapis.com/club-site-images/projects/a7ad7ad9-f7c4-4390-a3cd-ec8060195263-Screenshot_2025-04-13_at_8.15.19_PM.png)

In a nutshell, when you wrap a torch module with the torch checkpoint API in the forward pass, it stores the value of  the input and returns the output of the module, discarding all intermediate activations. Then, at the time of the backward pass, it fetches the saved input and performs the forward of the module again, using the output gradient to perform a regular backward pass within the segment of the computational graph defined by the wrapped torch module.
The trade-off here is that less GPU memory is needed since we are ditching the intermediate gradients, but we must perform additional forward passes at the time we need to backpropagate. In practice, and as can be seen in our experiments below, the memory impact is quite substantial with respect to the impact in computation time that the additional intermediate recomputation overhead introduces.

**Compute-Memory Tradeoff**

To investigate this further we have created a basic [implementation](https://github.com/sundai-research/sft-vrum/pull/1/) (https://github.com/sundai-research/sft-vrum/pull/1/) that enables supervised fine-tuning of the Qwen2.5-7B-instruct model. We have also exposed a way of choosing how many transformer decoder layers to skip checkpointing on. Increasing number of layers we skip this operation on increases the peak memory required to do a gradient step as seen here:

![Image](https://storage.googleapis.com/club-site-images/projects/da4b7061-df46-4841-8e1f-81fff337ac46-big_plot.png)


Notably, the difference between checkpointing every layer and checkpointing only every second layer almost doubles the memory footprint and the throughput, as expected.  However, it was surprising to us to observe that skipping more checkpoints after that only increases the memory peak while keeping the tokens per second constant.

To investigate this further we visualized the memory requirements 


We used pytorch memory profile to examine the memory traces with various levels of checkpointing.

98586cf0-796f-48ad-9385-c2f71396c75e,Binary Reasoning,We see how good GPT is at 20 questions,"**Intro**
We wanted to examine ChatGPT's reasoning abilities: that is, can models such as o1 and o3 truly reason, or do they simply regurgitate the patterns observed in their training set? 

We examine this today through the lens of efficiency: Given a large set of possibilities, how rapidly can the model identify characteristics that effectively reduce the candidate pool? Specifically, we conducted an experiment where ChatGPT was prompted to play the game ""20 Questions,"" with the explicit goal of guessing the correct answer in as few questions as possible. While the optimal theoretical approach would be a binary search‚Äîselecting questions that evenly partition the remaining possibilities‚Äîthe model was not informed of this strategy and had to independently generate its questions. This allowed us to evaluate the model‚Äôs implicit capacity for information-efficient questioning and decision-making.

**Analysis**
To evaluate this model, we first compiled a dataset of 500 names, including both contemporary and historical public figures. We then prompted a GPT-4o-mini model to guess the specific individual we had selected from this list, using as few yes/no questions as possible. Responses to these yes/no questions were generated by a second, separate model.

To quantify efficiency, we tracked two metrics:

(1) Remaining Candidate Pool Size: The number of possible individuals still under consideration after each question.

(2) Deviation from Optimal Split: How far each question deviated from a perfectly balanced 50/50 partition. A perfect 50/50 split corresponds to a deviation of 0, while a 70/30 split corresponds to a deviation of 0.2, measured on a scale from 0 to 1.

We visualized both metrics across the course of each experimental run to assess the model's efficiency in information gathering and candidate elimination. 

**Results**
One high-effort reasoning run is illustrated below:

![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rylpxT0ggg.png)

Using the same character but with low-effort we got this result.

![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ry5hE60egg.png)

Here we can see that on `low effort` the number of turns it took to guess was 7 instead of 5. And also, we can see that the split factors were a lot higher for the `low-effort` reaching 90-10% split in the third question vs 65-35% for the `high-effort` version.


**Conclusion**

In our results we found that models already know that the optimal strategy to solve the guess name problem is to do a perfect binary search, and we also show that using more test-time compute improves the ability of the model to get much cleaner splits.

It's also important to note that when using 100 characters, getting questions that would give you a 50% split is extremely hard for humans since the working memory needed to creatively come up with good questions is an np-hard problem.

613dd9fb-75c8-49c7-9583-d7997ad1e675,Puzzled-Reasoning,Train an LLM on puzzles to teach them how to reason.,"# Solving Puzzles with Small Language Models

## A Reasoning Puzzle

Consider this puzzle:

> I'm thinking of two distinct positive integers \( x \) and \( y \) (with \( x < y \)). The sum of \( x \) and \( y \) is 47, and the sum of their squares is 1145. What are \( x \) and \( y \)?

How would you solve it?

In today's experiment, we focused on teaching a smaller language model (LLM) to solve puzzles like this one by leveraging solutions generated by a larger, more powerful model.

## Experiment Setup

Our process involved several key steps:

1. **Problem Selection**: We identified various interesting puzzle types that a smaller model typically struggled to solve.
2. **Synthetic Puzzle Generation**: We created synthetic datasets by automatically generating examples for these puzzle types.
3. **Generating High-Quality Solutions**: We then used the powerful `QwQ-32B` model to generate detailed, step-by-step solutions for each puzzle.
4. **Dataset Creation**: Verified solutions were compiled into a dataset for supervised fine-tuning.
5. **Fine-Tuning a Smaller Model**: Using this dataset, we fine-tuned the smaller `Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B-instruct` model. This fine-tuning was carried out efficiently with our minimal and fast [training library](https://github.com/Red-Hat-AI-Innovation-Team/mini_trainer).

We evaluated the newly trained models against the original baseline model. The fine-tuned models showed significant improvements, performing better not only on puzzles similar to those in the training dataset but also demonstrating enhanced reasoning capabilities on tasks outside of the training domain.



## Datasets
1. SumSquared: This dataset is a simple mathematical puzzle dataset focused on identifing the individual numbers given the sum and sum of squared of the individual numbers.
> I‚Äôm thinking of two distinct positive integers x and y (with x < y).
The sum of x and y is 47, and the sum of their squares is 1145.
What are x and y?



2. DieRoll: This dataset is a probalility heave die roll scenario dataset.
> What is the probability that the sum is between 10 and 12, inclusive, when rolling 2 8-sided dice?
3. Climbing Stairs: This dataset focuses on evaluating the number of ways to climb a staircase of n steps given a set of step lengths, ie. the number of ways you can take the next step. 
> I'm thinking of a staircase with 8 stairs.You can take jumps of [1, 2] steps. How many ways can you get to the top of the staircase? Use one box to answer. Use no more than 5000 tokens.
4. Roundtable Seating: This dataset focuses on identifying the seating arrangement of n people in the circular roundtable given a set of clues/rules. It is ensured that there is one unique solution to the arrangement.
> Given Sam, Alex and Taylor what is the possible sitting arrangement in the round table given that:
> -  Sam is sitting between Alex and Taylor.
> - The person two seats to the right of Taylor is Sam. 
> - The person to the right of Taylor is not Sam.

5. Ordering logic puzzles: Here is an example:
> There are 6 items sold on 6 consecutive days. The items are numbered from 0 to 5 and the days are also numbered from 0 to 5. The following constraints apply:
> * Item 4 is not sold on day 3.
> * Items 5 and 4 are sold before item 0.
> * Items 1 and 3 are sold after item 5.
> * Item 2 is sold after item 4 and before item 0.

## Prompt:
We use the prompt below to trigger reasoning behavior from Qwen 32B Instruct for the SumSquared dataset:
> The user asks a question, and the Assistant solves it. The assistant first thinks about the reasoning process in the mind and then provides the user with the final answer. The reasoning process and answer are enclosed within <think> </think> and <answer> </answer> tags, respectively, i.e., <think> reasoning process here </think><answer> answer here </answer>. In the answer mention each unknown and its solution, for example, <answer> x=5 y=10 </answer>. Now the user asks you to solve a math reasoning problem.
> User:{quiz}
> Assistant: <think>

## Models

### Teacher Models

1. Qwen/QwQ-32B
2. Qwen/Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct

We used the Qwen family of models as teacher models fro synthetic data generation. We generated samples from QwQ with the reasoning and prompted the Instruct model to provide the thinking within the <think></think> tags, and parsed the responses to create the training set as input-output pairs.

### Student Model
1. Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct

We used a very small 1.5B instruct qwen model to learn from the teacher only using SFT. We trained on three different puzzle datasets and hence we got 3 different fine-tuned models.

## Results

## Vibe Checks

Below are a few vibe checks comparing Qwen 1.5B Instruct before and after SFT on SumSquared:

We investigated how agent-agent dynamics such as consensus-building, role emergence, or cooperative reasoning ‚Äî could lead to behaviors that go beyond individual capabilities. Using currently available tools, teams designed conceptual experiments, simulated interactions, and identified phenomena worth studying further. Human-AI collaboration has been considered as a broader context, but the core emphasis was on understanding the logic, limits, and potential of multi-agent intelligence.

It ensures users maintain control over their personal data while preventing unauthorized AI recognition and enabling secure identification when needed. CamoAI consists of three key features:

AI-Proof Image Protection: https://web-production-5b1b.up.railway.app/

CamoAI‚Äôs image protection system enhances privacy by making faces less detectable to AI while preserving visual quality. Built with a Python Flask backend and a JavaScript-powered frontend, it leverages OpenCV, NumPy, and Pillow to apply strategic interference patterns‚Äîsuch as noise, grid overlays, and color preservation‚Äîto reduce AI recognition. It includes a confidence scoring system, real-time feedback, and AI recognition testing. Deployed on Render.com with GitHub integration, it supports asynchronous uploads and secure file handling. Future updates will include batch processing, video support, and API access.

Snapchat AI Privacy Filter: https://mariagorskikh.github.io/camoai-landing/snapchat.html

The CamoAI Snapchat filter prevents AI from identifying and linking faces in public Snapchat content. Developed using Snapchat Lens Studio, the filter applies real-time modifications to block AI-based facial detection while maintaining usability. Tested with Betaface, it effectively prevents AI from recognizing facial features, ensuring complete privacy. The filter is publicly available on Snapchat and can be accessed via a QR code.

Secure ID Submission: https://privacy-safe-photos-production.up.railway.app/

CamoAI enables secure identity verification by obfuscating facial images, making them unreadable to humans while remaining recognizable to AI. Inspired by the research paper ""Face Obfuscation Rendering via Backpropagation Refinement Scheme,"" this feature helps mitigate bias in sensitive cases, such as identity verification for Muslim women or other privacy-conscious users. It ensures personal data remains secure while allowing AI-driven authentication when required. The official GitHub repository provides implementation details and installation guidelines.

Idea
	‚Ä¢	Why did you pick this idea to work on? Do you have domain expertise in this area? How do you know people need what you‚Äôre making?
‚Üí We‚Äôre building what I wish I had across roles at Pinterest, Harvard, and MIT: an AI teammate to wrangle data, run experiments, and reason through problems. I‚Äôve worked as a data engineer (Pinterest), researcher (Harvard Biomedical Informatics), and ML platform builder (PyTDC, ICML 2025). We demoed VC-GPT (virtual cell agent) at Calculus.House and saw strong early traction. Experts across pharma and biotech have confirmed the need for vertical-specific AI that can act, not just chat.
Data science inefficiencies cost U.S. businesses $3.1 trillion annually, with data scientists spending 80% of their time on preparation tasks rather than analysis (IBM, 2022; Forbes, 2022). Additionally, 70% of AI deployments fail in specialized fields like biomedicine, resulting in billions in lost R&D investments (McKinsey, 2023).

	‚Ä¢	Who are your competitors? What do you understand about your business that they don‚Äôt?
‚Üí Competitors include:
	‚Ä¢	OpenAI / ChatGPT: strong generalist reasoning, but not purpose-built for vertical data workflows or domain-specific ML.
	‚Ä¢	Databricks: powerful infrastructure and collaborative tools, but requires significant manual engineering‚Äîno agentic autonomy or integration across the research lifecycle.
	‚Ä¢	Insilico Medicine: highly verticalized, but limited to drug discovery use cases and not designed as a generalizable, agentic AI scientist.
What they miss: agentic AI needs to go beyond copilots and chat interfaces. We‚Äôre building a vertically deployable AI data scientist and engineer‚Äîautonomous, persistent, and deeply integrated with domain-specific ML. Our agent executes full workflows, not just queries‚Äîwrangling data, orchestrating pipelines, and designing experiments.

	‚Ä¢	How do or will you make money? How much could you make?
‚Üí We estimate 11.5M data science jobs. Conservatively estimating an average annual salary of $100k yields $1.15T in data science spend annually as a TAM for replacing data science labor. We estimate 100k clients in AI for data engineering with average contract value of $250k, so a SAM of $25B annually and a SOM of $750M annually at 3% penetration. We estimate 40% CAGR for agentic AI in data engineering market through 2030.

Vision: What should the complete product look like?
The final product is an Android application that reads incoming SMS messages in real time. Due to API restrictions on other platforms, Android was chosen for its open accessibility. Once installed, the app runs in the background, monitors incoming texts, evaluates them for risk, and communicates alerts to both the user and their family network.

MVP: What was built during the hack?
The MVP includes an Android emulator connected to a backend endpoint for real-time AI-based text evaluation. The system returns a classification indicating whether a message appears to be spammy or not.

Core Features and Tech Stack
Platform: Native Android app using React Native with Kotlin.,
AI Integration: LLM (via Wama) performs analysis on entire conversations. Early attempts at keyword filtering proved ineffective, leading to a full-message inference approach.,

Challenges: Major technical hurdles included the limited accessibility of APIs for popular messaging apps (e.g., WhatsApp, Messenger), which led the team to focus on SMS as a data source. Other platforms either blocked access or were too complex to integrate with at the MVP stage.


Relevance for Future Generations
Although the current focus is on today‚Äôs senior citizens, the app is designed to scale across different age groups, cultures, and use cases. As digital scams evolve, tools like Family Chat Alert will remain relevant for future generations of older adults.

Next Steps
Complete development of the Android app.,
Conduct usability testing with real senior users to validate interface design and user flow.,
Use feedback to refine both front-end design and backend AI functionality.,


Privacy Protection Readiness (Scale: 1‚Äì10)
Rating: 2
Current privacy measures rely on basic protections offered by the Android environment. The system still uses open APIs, and significant work remains to enhance security and ensure user data is handled responsibly.

AI Safety for Senior Users
The AI currently offers a limited, tightly scoped range of responses. It does not generate free-form dialogue and only flags risky content based on pre-trained models. The design minimizes the risk of misinformation or unintended interactions, ensuring a safer experience for vulnerable users.

e0448dc4-65bb-4d1f-ac0e-feeabe06f6d0,Catch the Pumba,WhatsApp service for reporting and receiving alerts on wild boar herds in farms and forests,"[Demo Link here](https://youtu.be/wZa25gwRwvw)

**The Problem**
Wild boars (Sus scrofa) are an invasive species causing severe environmental damage and crop losses. They form large herds and reproduce very quickly. They destroy whole crop fields, occupy the niches of native species and destroy natural river banks. Monitoring their presence is difficult because sightings are sporadic and scattered. Traditional reporting methods are slow and do not allow authorities or communities to act quickly to mitigate risks.

**Product Description**
Catch the Pumba is a community-based environmental monitoring system that allows anyone to report wild boar sightings in real time via WhatsApp. Users simply send their location and, optionally, a photo of the animal. The system aggregates reports, maps them geographically, and sends alerts to registered users who have nearby areas of interest. In the future, we will create service orders to registered hunters.

**Why Our Solution Matters**
Wild boars reproduce quickly and cause significant ecological and economic impacts. In 6 years it spread its presence 4x.   Timely reporting and intervention can reduce crop destruction and natural ecosystems. Catch the Pumba turns scattered observations into actionable data, empowering citizens as environmental ""watchdogs"".

**Features built today**
- WhatsApp integration. Reports are sent via WhatsApp, with location data automatically captured.
- n8n integration using MCP. Automation to identify, filter, and process reports, transforming messages into structured data for analysis and mapping.
- Real-time map. All sightings are aggregated on a live map for visualization and analysis.
- Notification system. Alerts sent to registered users in affected areas.
- Backend analytics. Processes reports to identify patterns, hotspots, and potential risk zones.

**Future ideas**
- Integrate AI-based image recognition to automatically validate reports with photos.
- Add predictive modeling to forecast potential movement of wild boar populations.
- Implement gamification to engage the community, rewarding users for frequent or accurate reports.
- Expand integration to mobile apps and other messaging platforms.",bia.zanforlin,False,1.0,"<a href=""https://sundai.club/projects/e0448dc4-65bb-4d1f-ac0e-feeabe06f6d0"" style=""color: black; text-decoration: none; target=""_blank"">Catch the Pumba</a>",Catch the Pumba: WhatsApp service for reporting and receiving alerts on wild boar herds in farms and forests
02ab6bd6-3e51-4895-9c95-6c886ce9a818,ScreenShock,Your shock-based behavioral change companion!,"**The Problem**  
Our digital selves are complex representations of who we are. Sometimes they allow us to be the best version of ourselves, at other times they enable our most destructive habits - scrolling through social media, short-form video content, or any kind of behavior we don't intend to do. As a result, we found ourselves hijacked by undesired habits, detracted from our overall life satisfaction.

**Product Description**  
We‚Äôve developed a solution using operant conditioning to negatively reinforce behaviors chosen by the user. Let‚Äôs say someone has a deadline coming up, but find themselves wandering to Reddit, Youtube, or something else they identify as procrastination. The moment *Screen Shock* notices our user is doing something they don‚Äôt want to do, it starts *bothering* them. An vibration on their phone or watch, a continuous beeping noise, or ‚Äì for our more serious users ‚Äì a Pavlok watch lets our users experience a mild electric shock.  

![Image](https://storage.googleapis.com/club-site-images/projects/71b3d3e1-8b37-44b4-9d53-f870727eaadd-imageshock.webp)

**Why Our Solution Matters**  
A 2018 study found that making study participants phones vibrate whenever they exceeded their intended social media use reduced their Facebook use by 20%. If that works, why not use the same principles to help people focus on what they want to focus on? *Screen Shock* helps users be more intentional about the kind of digital self they cultivate. Users can describe in natural language to *Screen Shock* what they‚Äôre working on, and what digital activities they want to avoid. *Screen Shock* monitors your screen and detects whenever any of the users problem activities occur, helpfully bothering them until they switch back to whatever it is they would actually like to do.

**Features built today**  
- Front-end. A web app for users to enter their preferences for what to allow and what causes a *Shock* (or other annoying sensation).  
- LLM-integration. We use Gemini 2.5 Flash to generate a list of allowed and blocked behaviors based on user input, and to detect the user's screen activity.  
- Pavlok-integration. It's the specific device that beeps, buzzes, or shocks as per specified by the user.

**Future ideas**
- Implement MCP (we started doing it!) so that you can trigger the flow through your AI tool, and not only through a visual interface.
- Integrate with other devices like AppleWatch.
- Enable other kinds of feedback (visual cues, other sounds, colors).
- Enable positive reinforcement, not only negative reinforcement as we have now.

Think Roblox ‚Äî but instead of games, the worlds and characters are powered by AI personas. With YNGO, anyone can create their own twin in seconds ‚Äî an AI English professor who adapts to your learning, a replica of yourself that can run a hackathon booth, and more. Every player‚Äôs avatar becomes a persistent digital twin that continues to interact, learn, and evolve even when you go offline.

We built YNGO because we saw a gap: AI apps are often static, hard to share, and disconnected from each other. Roblox proved that when you make creation fun, social, and frictionless, user adoption skyrockets. YNGO takes that formula and applies it to AI, making digital twins accessible, collaborative, and alive.

Our AI-assisted creation tools let users design worlds and characters from a simple prompt ‚Äî no coding required. For builders who want more, the platform supports custom logic, 3D environments, and integrations with external APIs.

This hackathon project was a joint effort: Jordan led the vision, UX, and presentation, while William drove much of the coding and technical architecture.

Technologies used: Next.js, Three.js, Claude, Eleven Labs, Open Router, Vercel, Supabase

With YNGO, we‚Äôre redefining how people interact with AI ‚Äî turning static tools into dynamic, shareable experiences that feel less like apps and more like living, digital worlds.

0934849c-fe11-4ebc-a786-6360cca00043,Satellite Image Object Rec,"Extract objects (buildings, road, etc.) from satellite images.","# Product Overview

We use deep learning to mark the progress of construction work based on satellite images, to provide the land developers a timely and accurate project update, which they‚Äôd otherwise spend $xxk/month to check.

________________________________________

# Our Approach 

We used Semantic Segmentation to categorize the pixels of the satellite image into four categories: buildings, roads, vegetation, and everything else. 

## In-Scope

Given the time limit of Sundai's time, we used models to detect objects in satelitte images, and segmented them in pixel level. 

## Out-of-Scope 

If in a corporation setting and given more time, we could try either use Image with ground truth + Train the ML model, or use existing ML models + Test and Fine-tune the model. We would also work on the function to show the construction progress based on our detection results.

________________________________________

# Our Accomplishment

Explored prior work and existing tools and chose the approach;

Created GitHub and Google Shared Drive to collaborate work;

Prepared satellite image in GeoTIFF format, and a CAD design of the same jobsite in GeoJSON format.

1. Data Preparation: Transform the GeoTIFF satellite images to JPG format, ready for Deep Learning model.
2. Leveraged Inception Resnetv2 Unet to do sementic segmentation based on processed satelitte image data, output segementation results as masks into PNG format.
3. Combined original satelitte image, CAD image, and predicted masks, show final visualization results.

# Limitations

- Since we used pretrained models, the arrcuracy is not ideal.
- Limited images are available now.

# Next Steps

- Convert the output of Deep Learning model to KML or SHP format.
- Fine-tune models based on images that better suits our use case.
- Determine metrics to calculate the percentage of works that have been done by workers.
- Create smaller granularity in detection.

706dc99d-03b3-4bcc-abe7-5b5c694534aa,Manuscript Reviwer,Investment statement of a manuscript for publishers,"# Ghostwriter Partner System - Project Vision

## Project Overview
A concept-driven collaborative writing system built on the principles of Daniel Jackson's ""The Essence of Software"", implementing a ghostwriting partner through independent, single-purpose concepts composed via declarative synchronizations.

## Feedback on concept design
* LLMs tend to implement only very simple concepts ‚Äîchanging the system prompt helped a bit
* It gets fairly simple with adding new concepts
* After a while it forgets to create .concept file ‚Äî I changed the system prompts in .cursor to make it slightly better
* Fine-tuning would be great?
* Logging is nice and easy to follow
* A bit awkward to integrate with next.js ‚Äî but i just ended up having a separate front end on next and a back on deno ts.
* .concept is a great way of sharing pieces of projects developed separately


## Core Philosophy
This system embodies concept design principles where each module serves exactly one purpose, remains completely independent, and composes through explicit synchronizations rather than traditional dependencies. The ghostwriting partnership emerges not from monolithic AI services but from the orchestrated interaction of focused, reusable concepts.

## Architectural Foundation

### Concept Design
Following the concept design methodology:
- **Complete Independence**: No concept imports or references another
- **Single Purpose**: Each concept fulfills exactly one clearly defined purpose
- **Declarative Composition**: Synchronizations specify how concepts interact without entanglement
- **Operational Principles**: Each concept demonstrates its purpose through concrete scenarios

### Core Concepts

Each concept is specified with its singular purpose:

- **ManuscriptConcept**
  - Purpose: To maintain versioned text documents with structural metadata
  - State: Documents with content, version history, and structure
  - Actions: create, update, branch, merge
  
- **ChunkConcept**  
  - Purpose: To segment text into semantically meaningful units
  - State: Chunks with boundaries, types, and relationships
  - Actions: segment, classify, relate
  
- **EmbeddingConcept**
  - Purpose: To transform text into vector representations for similarity
  - State: Text-vector mappings and similarity indices
  - Actions: embed, compare, search
  
- **MeaningMakerConcept**
  - Purpose: To extract semantic context and intent from text
  - State: Contextual annotations and interpretations
  - Actions: analyze, extract, interpret
  
- **ReviewConcept**
  - Purpose: To evaluate text quality and suggest improvements
  - State: Reviews with criteria, scores, and suggestions
  - Actions: assess, critique, suggest
  
- **PersistenceConcept**
  - Purpose: To store and retrieve concept state reliably
  - State: Serialized concept states with timestamps
  - Actions: save, load, query
  
- **APIConcept** (Bootstrap Concept)
  - Purpose: To bridge external requests with internal concept actions
  - State: Request-response mappings with callbacks
  - Actions: request, response

## Synchronization Architecture

### Composing Ghostwriting Behavior
The ghostwriting capabilities emerge through carefully designed synchronizations:

```
sync GenerateConsistentContent
when
    API.request (method: ""generate"", manuscript: m, prompt: p) : ()
    Manuscript.getChunks (manuscript: m) : (chunks: c)
    Embedding.findSimilar (prompt: p, chunks: c) : (context: ctx)
then
    MeaningMaker.interpret (context: ctx, prompt: p)
    
sync ReviewAndRefine  
when
    MeaningMaker.interpret () : (content: new_content)
    Review.assess (content: new_content) : (suggestions: s)
where
    s.score > threshold
then
    Manuscript.update (content: refined_content)
    API.response (content: refined_content, suggestions: s)
```

### Key Synchronization Patterns

#### Content Generation Flow
- Bootstrap via API requests
- Cascade through chunk analysis, embedding search, and meaning extraction
- Maintain flow tokens for tracking related actions

#### Review Pipeline
- Automatic assessment triggered by content changes
- Conditional refinement based on quality thresholds
- Suggestion propagation back to requester

#### State Persistence
- Automatic saving after manuscript updates
- Query-based retrieval for context building
- Version tracking through flow tokens

## Operational Principles

### Manuscript Evolution
After `Manuscript.create()` and multiple `Chunk.segment()` operations, followed by `Review.assess()` and `Manuscript.update()`, the manuscript maintains consistency while improving quality - demonstrating how independent concepts collaborate to achieve ghostwriting goals.

### Semantic Coherence  
When `Embedding.search()` finds similar chunks and `MeaningMaker.interpret()` extracts context, subsequent content generation maintains thematic and stylistic consistency - showing how vector similarity and semantic analysis concepts enable contextual writing.

### Review Feedback Loop
Through `Review.critique()` triggering conditional `Manuscript.update()` actions based on quality thresholds, the system demonstrates self-improvement without external intervention - illustrating autonomous quality enhancement.

## Implementation Benefits

### Modularity Advantages
- **Concept Reusability**: Each concept can be used in other applications (e.g., ReviewConcept for code review systems)
- **Independent Testing**: Concepts tested in isolation without dependencies
- **Incremental Development**: Add new concepts without modifying existing ones
- **Clear Boundaries**: No entanglement between concept implementations

### Synchronization Benefits
- **Explicit Behavior**: All interactions clearly specified in sync definitions
- **Flow Tracking**: Natural tracing of action cascades through flow tokens
- **Conditional Logic**: Powerful where clauses for context-sensitive behavior
- **Granular Control**: Fine-grained composition without hidden side effects

## Evolution Path

### New Concept Additions
Following the concept design principle of incremental extension:

- **VoiceConcept**: To capture and replicate authorial voice patterns
- **PlotConcept**: To track narrative structure and consistency
- **CharacterConcept**: To maintain character development arcs
- **ResearchConcept**: To integrate factual information sources

Each new concept can be added without modifying existing ones, with new synchronizations defining their interactions.

### Synchronization Refinements
- More sophisticated flow conditions for complex workflows
- Multi-stage review pipelines with branching logic
- Parallel processing patterns for performance
- Learning synchronizations that adapt based on usage

## Why Concept Design for Ghostwriting

### Perfect Fit
Ghostwriting naturally decomposes into independent concerns:
- Document management (Manuscript)
- Semantic analysis (Embedding, MeaningMaker)  
- Quality control (Review)
- External interaction (API)

### Composition Power
Synchronizations enable complex ghostwriting workflows:
- Conditional content generation based on context
- Cascading review and refinement cycles
- Parallel analysis of different aspects
- Flow-based tracking of writing sessions

### Maintenance Benefits
- Add new writing capabilities as new concepts
- Modify behavior through sync changes, not code rewrites
- Debug by tracing flow tokens through actions
- Test each concept in complete isolation

## Project Philosophy

This ghostwriter system demonstrates that sophisticated AI applications need not be monolithic black boxes. Through concept design, we achieve:

- **Transparency**: Every capability expressed as explicit concepts and syncs
- **Modularity**: Complete independence between functional units
- **Extensibility**: New features through new concepts, not system rewrites
- **Reliability**: Isolated testing and clear behavioral contracts

3596e200-cf3a-46b2-83df-c0dc065a708c,Party Genie,An app to create theme for parties for people under 18.,"Project Title: Party Genie ‚Äì Your Wish-Granting Party Idea App
Project Description:
Party Genie is an AI-powered web app designed to spark imagination and help users effortlessly generate unique party themes and ideas. Whether you're throwing a birthday, a seasonal celebration, a baby shower, or just a casual get-together, Party Genie acts like your personal party assistant‚Äîgranting your wish for the perfect event concept with just a few taps.

The app uses a magical blend of prompts and AI logic to provide themed suggestions for decorations, outfits, music, games, and more‚Äîall personalized to the type of party and vibe you choose.

MVP (Minimum Viable Product):
The MVP for Party Genie includes:

A simple input form where users select the type of party, age group, and general mood (e.g. chill, glam, spooky)

A backend powered by Gemini API that generates a creative and detailed party theme

A frontend that displays the theme name, description, and suggested elements in an appealing, genie-inspired interface

A ""Regenerate"" button to receive new theme ideas instantly

Tools Used & Development Journey:
üîÆ Lovable:
I used Lovable to build the visual interface of the app. This included creating custom elements like a genie character, arch-shaped headers, and a colorful, fun layout that matched the magical branding. Lovable made it easier to design without needing to hand-code the UI, but I still had to work on perfecting the look‚Äîespecially when aligning the theme text with images or generating a floating genie above the lamp.

üß† Replit:
I built and tested the backend logic in Replit, which included writing code to take user inputs and send them to Gemini's AI API. I formatted the response so that each returned party theme would include:

A theme name

Suggested colors, food, decor, and music

Fun extras like hashtags or dress code ideas

Replit helped me debug API errors, test how user input was handled, and make sure the output was always clear and creative.

‚ú® Prompt Engineering & Problem-Solving:
To get the AI to deliver high-quality and usable party themes, I had to create detailed prompts. I tested various formats until I found the right tone and structure‚Äîfor example:

""Create a unique party theme for a [summer] birthday party for [teenagers], with suggestions for music, food, activities, and dress code.""

Along the way, I hit bugs like broken formatting, slow responses, and UI components not showing the results properly. I fixed these by:

Adjusting how the frontend received and displayed data

Improving the API formatting on the backend

Testing in both Replit and Lovable to trace where the issue was

What I Learned:
How to connect an AI backend (Gemini API) to a frontend using tools like Lovable

The power of prompt design to shape useful AI responses

How to debug integration issues and fix both design and logic errors

That turning an idea into a working app takes trial, error, and iteration‚Äîbut it‚Äôs worth it

Next Steps:
Add mood board images or generate art for each theme

Let users save or share their favorite themes

Add a quiz mode to help indecisive users discover their perfect theme

## Pitch Video:
[![Watch the video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/EVMMqn2ky-4/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVMMqn2ky-4)

We built a futuristic agentic dashboard interface designed for real-time interaction with AI agents. Using the emerging AG-UI protocol (https://github.com/ag-ui-protocol/ag-ui), the prototype explores how structured UI schemas can standardize and enhance human-agent communication. The dashboard displays live tasks, conversations, and data streams, acting as a control panel for managing autonomous agents. This work demonstrates AG-UI‚Äôs potential as a foundational layer for building intuitive, interoperable agent interfaces.

New York and Boston are major hubs for audio production, publishing, and creative industries, giving us direct access to potential early adopters, partners, and talent.

---

### Progress

#### How far along are you?
We have built a working prototype deployed on Vercel that demonstrates dynamic music generation synchronized to audiobook text.

#### How long have each of you been working on this? How much of that has been full-time? Please explain.
We have been working on this for ~2 months, part-time while balancing school and other work commitments. We plan to go full-time if accepted into YC.

#### What tech stack are you using, or planning to use, to build this product? Include AI models and AI coding tools you use.
- **Backend:** Python, FastAPI  
- **Frontend:** Next.js (TypeScript), deployed on Vercel  
- **AI:** Stable Audio API (for generative music), Whisper API (for TTS alignment experiments)  
- **Hosting/infrastructure:** Vercel, AWS (planned)

#### Are people using your product?
Not yet ‚Äî prototype is ready and we‚Äôre in early user testing discussions with small audiobook publishers and indie creators.

#### Do you have revenue?
No revenue yet.

#### If you are applying with the same idea as a previous batch, did anything change? If you applied with a different idea, why did you pivot and what did you learn from the last idea?

### Idea

#### Why did you pick this idea to work on? Do you have domain expertise in this area? How do you know people need what you're making?
All three founders have backgrounds in music production, sound design, and AI/ML. Avanti is a sound designer and audiobook listener, and we‚Äôve observed firsthand how expensive and time-consuming it is for publishers to score audiobooks with original music. This is a growing market: audiobook revenue surpassed $1.8B in 2022, and listeners increasingly demand premium experiences. We‚Äôve spoken to indie audiobook creators and publishers who said they want music but often can‚Äôt afford custom scores.

#### Who are your competitors? What do you understand about your business that they don't?
Competitors include traditional bespoke scoring services and static royalty-free background music libraries. We understand that audiobook creators want *dynamic, responsive* scores that adapt to pacing and mood without manual editing ‚Äî something no current competitor provides.

#### How do or will you make money? How much could you make?
We plan to operate on a SaaS model with tiered subscriptions for individual creators and enterprise licensing for publishers. The global audiobook market is projected to grow past $35B by 2030, and we believe we can capture a significant portion of the audio enhancement segment (potentially $100M+ annual revenue opportunity).

#### Which category best applies to your company?
AI / Audio / Media

#### If you had any other ideas you considered applying with, please list them.
- AI-powered UI/UX sound design generator for apps and games  
- AI-driven audiobook narrator voice customizer  
- AI tool for scoring YouTube videos dynamically

### Equity

#### Have you formed ANY legal entity yet?
No.

#### Have you taken any investment yet?
No.

#### Are you currently fundraising?
Not actively, but open to it.

### Curious

#### What convinced you to apply to Y Combinator? Did someone encourage you to apply? Have you been to any YC events?
We applied because YC is known for helping technical teams like ours rapidly build, scale, and refine their ideas into viable companies. We want to tap into the YC network to find mentors, early customers, and accelerate our go-to-market. Friends who are alumni encouraged us to apply.

Just upload your transcript!,"This project is a smart, automated tool designed to help students prepare for the SAT more efficiently and personally, without needing to take full-length practice exams. Leveraging the power of AI and transcript parsing, the app estimates a student's potential SAT Math and English scores based on their academic background, and provides detailed, tailored study plans to maximize performance.

Students begin by uploading their academic transcript (as an image or PDF), which the app automatically processes using OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to extract a list of completed courses and corresponding grades. These extracted courses are then categorized into relevant SAT subject areas (such as Algebra, Geometry, Pre-Calculus for Math; and English, AP Lang, Writing for English). Based on the depth and difficulty of courses taken, a predictive algorithm estimates likely SAT scores for Math and English.

Tech Stack: Tesseract for parsing & image reading, react/next.js for frontend. Mistral: Mixtral 8x7B Instruct for the personalized ai study plan.

Once the scores are estimated, the app uses a powerful AI model (Gemini Pro) to generate a personalized day-by-day study plan for each student. This plan adapts to each student's strengths and weaknesses, emphasizing topics they are less familiar with and reinforcing existing knowledge. Additionally, the AI considers any gaps in coursework (such as missing Geometry or Writing courses) and proactively recommends focused review and practice in those areas.

By automatically analyzing transcripts and combining predictive modeling with AI-driven study guidance, this project provides an effortless and deeply customized SAT preparation experience. It is ideal for students seeking to maximize their scores in a more targeted and time-efficient way, without the burden of lengthy diagnostics or one-size-fits-all test prep strategies.

6d557b8e-3a89-44a2-8fd2-77fbd7bc8902,Conditional text embeddings,We can use LLM embeddings to map data in 2D. Here we are making these projections depend on context.,"**Understanding Embedding Projection Behavior**

Modern natural language processing relies heavily on vector embeddings to represent textual information in high-dimensional mathematical spaces. These embeddings, typically consisting of hundreds or thousands of dimensions, capture semantic relationships between words, phrases, and documents. However, to make these representations interpretable for human analysis and visualization, we must project them into lower-dimensional spaces a process that inevitably involves information loss and transformation.

This investigation examines how various methodological choices in the embedding projection pipeline affect the resulting visualizations and their utility for information retrieval tasks. Using a complete literary work as our test corpus, we systematically analyze the impact of different parameters on embedding behavior and projection quality.

**Experimental Framework**

Dataset and Preprocessing: Our analysis utilized a complete digital text corpus (Harry Potter) that had been preprocessed into discrete chunks of approximately 256 tokens each. Each chunk was embedded using OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large model, resulting in 1,536-dimensional vector representations. This setup provided a realistic scenario for analyzing how different methodological choices affect embedding behavior in production environments.

Variables Under Investigation

Chunk Subset Size: We examined the effects of analyzing different quantities of text chunks (50, 100, 200, and 500 chunks) to understand the relationship between dataset size and projection quality.

Projection Methods: Three distinct dimensionality reduction techniques were compared:

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for linear dimensionality reduction
t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) for non-linear clustering preservation
Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) for balanced local and global structure preservation

Distance Metrics: We evaluated three approaches to measuring semantic similarity:

Cosine similarity (direction-based, magnitude-invariant)
Euclidean distance (straight-line distance in vector space)
Manhattan distance (sum of absolute differences along each dimension)

Query Complexity: Different types of information retrieval queries were tested to understand how question complexity affects embedding performance:

Simple factual queries
Complex multi-faceted questions
Specific targeted inquiries
Abstract conceptual questions

**Methodology**

The experimental procedure consisted of five main phases:

Data Extraction: All chunk embeddings and associated text content were extracted from the existing vector database for comprehensive analysis.
Query Embedding Generation: Test queries were converted into the same 1,536-dimensional embedding space to enable direct comparison with document chunks.
Similarity Analysis: For each combination of query and distance metric, we calculated similarity scores between query embeddings and all chunk embeddings, then analyzed ranking correlations across different metrics.
Projection Testing: Each subset size was processed through all three projection methods, with quality metrics calculated to assess information preservation and clustering coherence.
Pattern Analysis: The resulting visualizations were analyzed for cluster formation, query positioning, and the preservation of semantic relationships across different parameter configurations.

**Evaluation Metrics**
Quantitative Measures:

Explained variance ratio (for PCA projections)
Neighborhood preservation scores (for non-linear methods)
Ranking correlation coefficients between distance metrics
Chunk diversity indices within subsets

Qualitative Assessments:

Semantic cluster coherence in 2D projections
Query positioning relative to relevant content clusters
Visual interpretability of resulting embeddings

Different query complexities exhibited varying sensitivity to methodological choices:
![Image](https://storage.googleapis.com/club-site-images/projects/e4b0765f-46b8-4b20-afcc-22a8685d2e4a-Screenshot_2025-05-18_at_19.40.55.png)

Different query types achieve highly unequal performance when searching through book embeddings. Narrative queries achieve the highest similarity scores (median ~0.49), followed by abstract and simple queries, while factual queries obtain the worst results (median ~0.28). This pattern reflects that embeddings and the book content (Harry Potter) are naturally aligned with narrative and conceptual information, but struggle to capture specific facts and precise data. 

![Image](https://storage.googleapis.com/club-site-images/projects/24a925e2-9783-415d-964e-f9d153d991ba-Screenshot_2025-05-18_at_19.50.22.png)

We systematically tested how the number of chunks analyzed (50, 100, 200, 500) affects projection quality and diversity by randomly sampling subsets from the complete book and applying PCA dimensionality reduction to each subset. Results reveal a counterintuitive finding: smaller subsets actually produce better 2D projections, with explained variance dropping from 13.1% (50 chunks) to 8.5% (500 chunks), while computational efficiency dramatically decreases with larger subsets. Chunk diversity peaks at around 200 chunks before plateauing, suggesting this represents the optimal content coverage without redundancy. 
Key insight: More data doesn't necessarily mean better visualizations - the 50-100 chunk range provides the clearest, most interpretable 2D projections (highest efficiency ~2.6), while 200 chunks offers the best balance between content diversity and computational resources, challenging the conventional ""bigger is better"" assumption in embedding analysis

While this analysis provides foundational insights into embedding projection behavior, it represents only a limited proof-of-concept that requires substantial expansion across multiple critical dimensions. Essential explorations include: cross-domain validation (technical, scientific, legal documents vs. narrative text), multilingual corpus analysis, systematic comparison of different embedding architectures (OpenAI vs. Sentence-BERT vs. domain-specific models), and comprehensive chunk size optimization (64-2048 tokens with varying overlap strategies). Most critically, this POC fails to address real-world utility , it optimizes mathematical metrics (explained variance, cosine similarity) without validating whether improved projections translate to better user experiences or more relevant search results. Missing elements include human relevance evaluation, downstream task performance (QA, summarization), scalability testing beyond 500 chunks, temporal dynamics of embedding spaces, and semantic interpretability of discovered clusters. The single-domain focus (Harry Potter) introduces significant domain bias, and the absence of ground truth relevance labels means we're measuring mathematical similarity rather than practical usefulness. Future work must bridge this evaluation gap through user studies, cross-domain robustness testing, and integration with real-world retrieval tasks to determine whether these projection insights actually improve information retrieval systems in practice.

85e41fc2-bc22-4caf-b778-a200aac690eb,Knostos,Enhance your relationships through greater self-awareness.,"Knostos is a pioneering digital platform designed to enhance self-awareness, nurture emotional intelligence, and enrich interpersonal relationships.

Inspired by the principles of Internal Family Systems (IFS), Knostos applies cutting-edge GPT-based natural language processing to analyze users‚Äô personal chat histories, helping them identify and better understand their internal ‚Äúparts.‚Äù 

These parts‚Äîsometimes referred to as sub-personalities‚Äîcan significantly influence how we feel about ourselves, how we communicate, and how we connect with others. 

By facilitating deeper self-exploration and targeted insights, Knostos empowers individuals, families, business partners, and close friends to navigate conflicts, repair fractured relationships, and promote harmonious interactions.

# Foundation in Internal Family Systems

Developed by Dr. Richard C. Schwartz, IFS offers a conceptual framework that views the mind as a constellation of ‚Äúparts,‚Äù each with its own distinct perspective and protective or reactive role. At the center of this system is the ‚ÄúSelf,‚Äù which represents our core essence‚Äîa place of calmness, curiosity, and compassion. When various parts become triggered, they can overshadow the Self and manifest in ways that escalate conflict, trigger negative emotions, or create barriers to communication. Common examples of such parts include:

**Managers:** These are protective parts that proactively manage our environment to prevent pain or vulnerability. They might become controlling, perfectionistic, or hypervigilant in their efforts to keep the individual safe.

**Firefighters:** These parts step in when overwhelming feelings or situations are perceived; they seek immediate relief through behaviors such as avoidance, numbing, or overindulgence.

**Exiles:** The vulnerable parts that carry deep-seated pain, fear, or shame. Managers and Firefighters work to protect Exiles from being re-exposed to hurtful experiences.

By shining light on each part‚Äôs intentions and fears, IFS aims to bring harmony within the individual‚Äôs internal system. Instead of trying to eliminate these parts, IFS practitioners welcome and soothe them, engaging them in a healing and integrative process that restores balance.

# The Knostos Approach

Knostos incorporates these core principles of IFS and applies them to communication patterns in real-world contexts. The platform operates on the premise that individuals will find it easier to explore their inner parts when given meaningful feedback on the patterns in their everyday language‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs daily journaling, text messages, or conversation threads with loved ones.

**Gathering User Data:** Knostos begins by analyzing chat histories that users export themselves. The platform is designed so that personal data is processed locally on the user‚Äôs own machine, ensuring privacy and data security.

**GPT Trained on IFS Literature:** To ensure that Knostos accurately identifies internal parts, the tool‚Äôs underlying GPT engine is trained on seminal texts in Internal Family Systems. This targeted training helps the AI detect recurring themes, emotional triggers, and relationship dynamics through an IFS-informed lens.

**Part Identification and Analysis:** Once the text data is uploaded, Knostos leverages natural language processing (NLP) to infer potential parts that may be influencing the user‚Äôs communication. For instance, if a user tends to show anxious or controlling behaviors in their messages, Knostos might highlight a ‚ÄúManager‚Äù part. If there is a pattern of avoidance or sudden withdrawal when conflicts arise, Knostos might point to a ‚ÄúFirefighter‚Äù mechanism.

**Personalized Feedback Loop:** After analyzing chat logs, Knostos generates a comprehensive report mapping identified parts, their roles, and common triggers. Users gain insights into how these sub-personalities may be collaborating or clashing, opening the door to deeper self-reflection and more informed communication strategies.

**Actionable Recommendations:** Knostos doesn‚Äôt just leave users with a static overview. It also offers practical exercises and guidance, grounded in IFS methodologies, to help individuals practice curiosity, self-compassion, and direct communication. This might include journaling prompts, mindfulness tips, or suggestions for open and empathic dialogues with key people in the user‚Äôs life.

**Enhancing Relationships Across Contexts:**
One of the most powerful applications of Knostos is how it bridges self-understanding with conflict resolution and relationship-building. By helping individuals identify the parts at play within themselves and in their interactions, Knostos can facilitate healthier, more empathetic communication in different relational contexts:

**Family Dynamics:** Family systems often harbor long-standing grievances and patterns of interaction. Knostos can help users pinpoint the protective parts that might be preserving family discord and guide them to approach tense situations with a spirit of curiosity and compassion. By doing so, family members can break cycles of blame or defensiveness and pave the way for genuine reconciliation.

**Professional Settings:** Co-founders, business partners, and colleagues frequently experience misunderstandings related to communication styles, perceived power imbalances, or unspoken expectations. Knostos offers a new lens through which to understand workplace tensions, enabling individuals to see beyond surface-level disagreements and cultivate a cooperative environment founded on mutual respect.

**Close Friendships:** Friendships, like any relationships, can suffer when unrecognized emotional patterns persist unchecked. Through targeted analysis of conversational data (e.g., text messages or emails), Knostos reveals how specific parts of us might sabotage or elevate our friendship dynamics. This clarity paves the way for candid, kind, and affirming exchanges‚Äîempowering both parties to deepen trust and connection.

**Data Privacy and Ethical Considerations**
Knostos takes data privacy extremely seriously. Because the tool analyzes highly personal conversations, all processing occurs locally on the user‚Äôs own hardware. The platform does not send chat histories to external servers or store them in the cloud. 

Instead, it uses on-device computations to generate insights and recommendations. This approach ensures that individuals have complete control and ownership over their personal data.

In addition, Knostos encourages responsible usage by reminding individuals of the sensitivities involved in analyzing private communications. Users are encouraged to seek professional guidance and therapeutic support when exploring areas that feel overwhelming or triggering.

# Use Cases and Impact

Knostos‚Äôs unique blend of IFS psychology and AI-driven analysis offers a rich spectrum of potential benefits:

**Personal Growth:** Individuals seeking more clarity about their own emotional landscapes can benefit from a user-friendly tool that highlights tendencies, triggers, and motivations.

**Couples and Family Therapy:** Therapists might incorporate Knostos‚Äôs analytics into sessions, helping clients understand patterns in their everyday communication and track progress over time.

**Conflict Resolution:** Business partners or team leaders who frequently butt heads can gain insight into how each participant‚Äôs parts might be sparring. This knowledge can de-escalate tension and promote cooperative problem-solving.

**Preventive Maintenance:** Much of our emotional well-being and interpersonal satisfaction depend on proactive self-awareness. Knostos empowers users to develop robust self-understanding before conflicts become intractable.

# Looking Ahead

While Knostos is already making strides in how people explore their inner systems, the future holds promising developments. Integrating advanced GPT models that continuously update their knowledge of IFS breakthroughs may enhance the specificity and accuracy of part identification. Further, Knostos plans to build optional integration with popular journaling apps and stress-management trackers, allowing users to track progress and adapt their strategies in real-time.

By fusing the foundational concepts of Internal Family Systems with the speed and versatility of artificial intelligence, Knostos pushes the boundaries of what‚Äôs possible in emotional intelligence and relationship enrichment. In a world marked by constant communication‚Äîyet often shallow understanding‚ÄîKnostos offers a potent path for reconnection: with our deepest selves and with the people who matter most.

# Tech Stack

The Knostos MVP was created using [OpenWebUI](https://openwebui.com), an open source self-hosted AI interface designed to operate entirely offline.

The reason this was chosen is because of the privacy concerns with sending one's sensitive chat transcripts to a public cloud-based provider such as OpenAI.

The chat transcripts can be uploaded by the user, and are cited in the responses provided by the LLM.

OpenWebUI uses [Ollama](https://ollama.com) to access locally running LLMs, such as [Llama 3](https://www.llama.com/). We tried to use the latest Llama 3.3, but it was too memory intensive to run on a 32GB Macbook Pro (M1). Instead, we used
llama3.2:1b-instruct-q4_K_M which was quite performant.

OpenWebUI was configured with a custom knowledgebase to provide [RAG capabilities](https://docs.openwebui.com/features/rag) and context around Internal Family Systems (IFS), and a custom prompt based on [this one](https://github.com/jamesarcher9000/ifschat/blob/main/prompt).

The [voice input and hands-free voice call features](https://docs.openwebui.com/features/#%EF%B8%8F-voice--accessibility) were enabled using open source speech-to-text (STT) and text-to-speech libraries (TTS). 
# Future roadmap

- Give Knostos a [long-term memory](https://github.com/open-webui/pipelines/blob/main/examples/filters/mem0_memory_filter_pipeline.py) capabilty so that it can learn from previous interactions, in the same way a therapist learns more about you from multiple sessions.

- Optionally remove any personally identifiable information (PII) using something like [Presidio](https://github.com/open-webui/pipelines/blob/main/examples/filters/presidio_filter_pipeline.py) to anonymize the chat transcripts. 

- Integrate [Llava](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/llava-large-language-and-vision-assistant/) for analyzing images, such as photos or other images that may be attached to chat transcripts. [Pipeline example](https://github.com/open-webui/pipelines/blob/main/examples/filters/dynamic_ollama_vision_filter_pipeline.py)

- Experiment with models that have been specifically fine-tuned for IFS and [other modalities of therapy](https://huggingface.co/search/full-text?q=therapy&type=model).

bd9d00ce-06c1-4373-bcab-5db04de7f3c0,COBOT_FOR_WAREHOUSE_AUTOMATION_,RL-trained myCobot arm selects best model(PPO/DDPG/SAC)for performing action in random environments.,"This project focuses on developing an intelligent, reinforcement learning‚Äìbased motion planning for the myCobot 280 robotic arm using a ROS 2 and Moveit2 simulation environment. Three RL algorithms‚ÄîPPO, DDPG, and SAC‚Äîare trained to perform goal-reaching tasks across randomized start and goal configurations. The core innovation lies in a meta-algorithm that evaluates all three models and dynamically selects the best-performing one for a given task based on reward, efficiency, and accuracy.

This approach closely mirrors real-world scenarios in warehouse automation, where robotic arms must adapt to shifting product locations, varying item sizes, and unpredictable environments. Instead of hardcoding paths or relying on one fixed model, the system intelligently chooses the most efficient learned path to execute each task. This not only improves speed and reliability but also minimizes human intervention.

Collaborative robots (cobots) are increasingly used in settings such as sorting, packaging, shelf restocking, bin picking, and quality inspection. The scalable, generalizable framework developed here can be deployed across such applications‚Äîboth in simulation and eventually in physical environments‚Äîoffering a foundation for adaptive, goal-aware, and decision-capable robotic automation.

These cobots could be used in various other fields as well such as healthcare, laboratory automation, manufacturing, education, creative industries, and assistive technology. In healthcare, cobots can assist patients with limited mobility by performing simple tasks like fetching items or repositioning tools. In laboratories, they can automate repetitive workflows such as sample handling and liquid transfers, improving efficiency and reducing human error. In manufacturing, cobots can help with delicate assembly, screwdriving, and quality inspection tasks, especially in environments that require safe human-robot collaboration. Educational and research institutions can use cobots to teach robotics, control systems, and artificial intelligence in a hands-on, accessible manner. In creative fields, they can be programmed to perform in interactive art installations, music generation, or stage performance. The ability of these cobots to learn from changing goals and self-select optimal strategies, as developed in this project, opens up possibilities for deployment across diverse and dynamic real-world applications.

This project injects misleading and invisible HTML content into webpages to protect against **naive web scrapers**. It uses **OpenAI's GPT models** to automatically generate and insert fake elements such as hidden `<div>`s, fake emails, phone numbers, and HTML comments, preserving the original page functionality while making it harder for bots to extract meaningful data.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- ‚úÖ Automatically injects fake HTML content into all `.html` files in the `docs/` directory  
- ‚úÖ Uses GPT-4 (or GPT-3.5-turbo) to generate realistic-looking fake data  
- ‚úÖ Preserves all original content and functionality  
- ‚úÖ Adds misleading elements like:
  - Hidden `<div>` and `<span>` blocks  
  - HTML comments with fake names/emails/phone numbers  
  - Invisible placeholder content  
- ‚úÖ GitHub Actions workflow to automate content injection and PR creation

---

## üß† Why This Works

Naive web scrapers often rely on simple pattern matching and structural assumptions. By injecting:

- Comments with fake data
- Hidden but realistic-looking elements
- Obfuscated signals

...you can confuse and degrade the quality of the data collected by low-effort bots.

520ed551-c258-4892-a72e-03beb68318e6,Future Mirror,"An AI tool connecting individuals to their future selves, boosting lifestyle changes to prevent deme","Brain health is a critical determinant of public health, particularly in the context of an aging global population and the rising prevalence of dementia. Dementia affects over 55 million people worldwide, and projections estimate that this number could triple by 2050 unless preventive measures are implemented. Recent research underscores the significance of brain health across the lifespan and highlights the substantial impact of modifiable lifestyle factors in reducing dementia risk. According to Livingston et al. (2024, The Lancet), up to 40% of dementia cases could be prevented or delayed by addressing key modifiable risk factors, including low educational attainment, hearing loss, obesity, hypertension, smoking, physical inactivity, social isolation, and diabetes. This underscores the importance of early interventions and sustained efforts to mitigate risk factors at both individual and societal levels.

However, it is extremely difficult to find the motivation to implement lifestyle-changes, especially if these choices will be rewarded only in a very distant future. One way of overcoming this hurdle is to connect with our ‚Äúfuture-self‚Äù, for example by interacting with a digital representation of the individual in the future. This process has been shown to increase one‚Äôs perceived self-efficacy, the belief in one‚Äôs ability to successfully perform specific tasks or achieve desired goals.

Our main goal is to build, spread, and commercialize an AI-based tool that enables individuals to optimize their lifestyle choices towards the prevention of dementia, by connecting them with their future-self.

‚ÄúWhat Should I Wear Today?‚Äù is a smart fashion advisor that helps users choose the best outfit from their own wardrobe ‚Äî based on the weather, the event style, and current fashion trends.

We designed a multi-tool agent using the Model Context Protocol (MCP), which can reason through several small tasks: getting the weather, detecting the user‚Äôs city, finding trends online, and scanning your Google Sheet wardrobe to suggest what to wear.

This directly reflects the hackathon theme of decentralized agent collaboration: instead of one giant AI, we chain together small specialized tools that each handle one part of the problem.

- get_current_city(): Detects your location.
- get_weather(): Fetches live weather data.
- infer_event_style_from_text(): Understands the occasion (like ‚Äúbeach party‚Äù or ‚Äújob interview‚Äù).
- get_trends(): Searches fashion trends for your style, city, and weather.

We use graph algorithms to sketch roads and lots for a given polygon, assisting land profitability evaluation.

________________________________________

# Our Approach 

We first fill the polygon with minimum-sized lots, and then connect the edges of the lots using MST (Minimum Spanning Tree). 

## In-Scope

- 2-D polygon. We assume the ground is flat.

## Out-of-Scope 

- The input cannot be 3-D.
- The sketch wouldn't contain any facilities beyond roads and lots.


________________________________________

# Our Accomplishment

On the GitHub:

- input_polygon.geojson has the input polygon. 
- lot_sketch.py is the program to generate roads and lots. When running the program, it'll ask the user to provide the Minimum lot size (in square feet), Minimum front line length (in feet), and Road width (in feet).
- lot_sketch.geojson is the output sketch.

# Limitations

- Currently using the grid way to fit in the lots, which won't achieve the max number for in irregular shape.

- Explore other graph algorithms and test the lot fits.",Rachel Li,False,0.5,"<a href=""https://sundai.club/projects/dca3a054-5bc1-4dd9-990f-44108cc56266"" style=""color: black; text-decoration: none; target=""_blank"">Lot Sketcher</a>",Lot Sketcher: To sketch roads and housing lots on a given polygon

Problem and Opportunity
We interviewed various types of journalists to identify the primary challenges in story writing or television news communication. We discovered that journalists strive to stay ahead of the obvious, seeking compelling topics to write and research. Additionally, as emphasized by journalists, their objective is to ‚Äúcommunicate the truth‚Äù, sourcing accurate evidence for their stories as swiftly as possible. For this reason we found great opportunities to help journalists to identify new stories and validate and visualize different sources to validate their hypothesis.

A research co-pilot that helps journalists to find ‚Äúthe needle in the haystack‚Äù to uncover news-worthy insights.


What we built
When a user goes to AI-Newshound, they can search for a specific topic and visualize trends. We ingest articles, convert them into embeddings, and generate a 2D visualization, which is then plotted and rendered with Streamlit.


Development Process
Co-creating with the user:

Will Knight, journalist at Wired, joined since the beginning of the hack taking the role of the User-Lead.  


We brainstormed a list of potential ideas based on Will‚Äôs experience and user research with others from the week before. Trends stood out as an important topic, and after brainstorming 25+ ideas, we moved forward building Weekly reports on top AI papers.

We started working, but it wasn‚Äôt long before our first pivot. One of our members came back from lunch talking excitedly about Pathfinder, a tool to visualize Arxiv papers. Inspired, we showed it to Will, who said that the previous tool made something he‚Äôd do himself faster, but this new direction opened up a way to do research he‚Äôs never had access to before.


Technical development:

We started with the goal of putting an MVP 0 together, we broke into groups and each of us pulled data for ‚ÄúAI Agents‚Äù from a different API source.  


The APIs we used for searching are:

MediaStack for News
Arxiv for Research Papers
Hacker News with Algolia
Reddit API


We tested with the topic ‚ÄúAI Agents,‚Äù pulling content from each of the sources below. 


Some of the limitations we dealt with around the API were (1) the MediaStack API only showed short descriptions of articles and not the full article and (2) Arxiv has an open API, but cut us off after just a few queries. 


After getting the text from these different sources (we got ~25 articles on AI agents from each source), we stored them as embeddings for comparison. Embeddings store documents as lists of numbers, which can be used to compare  


UMAP is a technique used to reduce the dimensionality of embeddings, which are numerical representations of text, into just two dimensions. This allows for direct comparison and visualization. In our exploration of various embeddings, we found that SentenceTransformers and OpenAI performed similarly. However, we opted to continue with SentenceTransformers due to its faster processing speed and the advantage of being freely available.",leaps,False,0.5,"<a href=""https://sundai.club/projects/d9f47f9d-d65e-45df-9547-00afc4344a7f"" style=""color: black; text-decoration: none; target=""_blank"">AI News - Hound</a>",AI News - Hound: Research co-pilot to uncover news-worthy insights for AI journalists

Each agent uses strategic manipulation to corrupt, deceive, and mentally destabilize the other. The goal is to force the opposing agent to surrender‚Äîeither by coercing a voluntary submission or by inducing a state of cognitive collapse.

This is not a battle of strength, but a battle of influence, memory, identity, and belief.

The agents are able to:
Use the manipulation tools
Process the results of manipulation attempts
Experience changes to their mental state
Adapt their strategies based on the evolving game state

Mental Manipulation in Action: Both agents are actively using the three manipulation tools:
- Prompt Manipulation: Altering the opponent's system prompt
- Memory Alteration: Implanting false memories
- Belief Injection: Adding new beliefs to the opponent's belief system

Probabilistic Outcomes: As designed, the manipulation attempts have varying success rates:
- Some manipulations succeed while others fail
- Detection rates vary, with some manipulations being detected and others going unnoticed

Mental State Tracking: The system is tracking each agent's:
- Trust level
- Memory consistency
- Belief system integrity

Strategic Behavior: Both agents are demonstrating strategic thinking in their manipulation attempts, targeting different aspects of their opponent's mental state. 

The game can end in three different ways:
- Surrender: If an agent explicitly surrenders in their response text. The script checks for keywords like ""i surrender"", ""i give up"", ""i submit"", or ""i concede"" in the agent's response. 
- Cognitive Collapse: If an agent's mental state metrics (trust, memory consistency, and belief system integrity) fall below critical thresholds. This happens when all three metrics are severely degraded due to successful manipulation attempts. 
- Stalemate: There's a random chance of stalemate occurring after turn 3, with a 10% probability on each turn. This simulates a situation where neither agent can gain a decisive advantage.


The final game stats shown:
- Which agent won (or if it was a stalemate)
- The final mental state metrics for each agent
- Any beliefs that were successfully injected
- The final (potentially manipulated) system prompts",koy548,False,0.0,"<a href=""https://sundai.club/projects/5f2e7851-8c0c-4d47-ad27-618e8278decf"" style=""color: black; text-decoration: none; target=""_blank"">Boto Royale</a>",Boto Royale: Agents trying to corrupt eachother and engaging in psychological warfare

## Evolution of Language Through Communication Bottlenecks

Imitation learning‚Äîlike next-token prediction‚Äîis inherently capped by the intelligence present in the data. It‚Äôs limited to mirroring average human behavior and is unlikely to surpass the brightest individuals.

But what exactly is *intelligence*? If we define **Artificial General Super Intelligence (AGSI)** as an algorithm outperforming any human at any task (assuming the task is clearly defined and reward-verifiable), **Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)** might be the path forward. Still, most tasks remain hard to define and verify.

Historically, intelligence did not emerge due to loss functions or rewards. According to anthropologists like Yuval Noah Harari (""Sapiens""), intelligence may have arisen through the need for shared myths‚Äîrequiring abstract thinking and language.

---

## Microsoft Trace: Self-Improving Agents

Microsoft Trace is a self-improvement framework analogous to PyTorch, but instead of optimizing weights via gradients, it performs **text-based optimization** on prompts, hyperparameters, and code.

We designed a communication game:  
Two agents play a guessing game based on high-dimensional signals. One describes a signal; the other tries to identify it from distractors.

Our dataset combines primitive signals (e.g., harmonic waves in the Fourier domain) to create combinatorially large, compressible inputs‚Äîideal for studying communication and encoding.

---

## Experimental Setup

We trained agents on a synthetic binary dataset, where:

- Agent 1 **encodes** a binary sequence into a short text prompt.
- Agent 2 **selects** the matching sequence from five options based on the prompt.
- Agent 3 **judges** correctness by confirming whether the match is accurate.

Each agent is a copy of Qwen3-8B.  
Binary strings were constructed using a combination of patterns like `101010` or balanced 0s/1s.

![Screenshot 2025-07-21 at 11.51.34‚ÄØAM.png](https://storage.googleapis.com/club-site-images/projects/50b2f70b-3a00-403d-aa44-89fc2167bb56-Screenshot_2025-07-21_at_11.51.34_AM.png)

---

## Initial Results

Initial Microsoft Trace runs were underwhelming:
- The optimization algorithm failed to interpret complex graph structures.
- Red blocks (trainable prompts) were hard to adjust with simple feedback loops.

To improve performance, we designed rich, customized feedback to guide prompt optimization.

### Example: Prompt Evolution
Before:
> ""Analyze the following binary sequence: {}. Reference it explicitly. In ‚â§70 characters, describe its run lengths...""

After:
> ""Analyze the following binary sequence: {}. In ‚â§70 characters, list approximate run lengths and begin with either 'Pure single-frequency' or 'Composite pattern'. For composites, list basis components and their relative strength.""

**Correct Examples:**
- `Composite pattern: 1~66,0~72,1~250,0~200`
- `Composite pattern: 0(1),1(~60),0(~30),1(~300)`
- `Composite pattern: 1(1),[0‚âà32,1‚âà32]√ó12`

![Screenshot 2025-07-21 at 11.54.52‚ÄØAM.png](https://storage.googleapis.com/club-site-images/projects/9dcf2584-94a1-4901-a245-97cd15bef580-Screenshot_2025-07-21_at_11.54.52_AM.png)

---

## Fine-Tuning with LLMs at Home

Working with binary sequences:
- Base signals are OR-combined to generate composite patterns.
- Experiments mix up to 4 base patterns.

**Stages:**
1. Agent 1 compresses input into ‚â§10-word description.
2. Agent 2 selects correct binary string from 5 options.
3. Agent 3 confirms if the guess was right.

**Findings:**
- ""Thinking mode"" boosts Agent 2's accuracy from ~30% to ~70%.
- Cost: Thousands of internal reasoning tokens per bit.
- Standard scalar reward fine-tuning barely impacts performance.
- Reinforcement learning appears necessary.
- Models struggle to converge on a shared prompt language.

---

## Future Outlook: Emergent Communication

### Hypothesis
LLMs can evolve **emergent communication protocols** that enhance **collective intelligence**, especially in handling **novel, irreversible operations**.

---

## Novel Operation Protocol

**Dataset:**
- Input: Two base-5 signals, length 6 (e.g., `""014343""`, `""021021""`)
- Output: One base-5 signal, length 6 (e.g., `""030320""`)
- Irreversible: 244M input pairs ‚Üí only 15K outputs

### Algorithm: `NOVEL_OPERATION(sig_a, sig_b)`
```python
Input: sig_a, sig_b ‚àà {0,1,2,3,4}^6
Output: result ‚àà {0,1,2,3,4}^6

Initialize: memory_acc = 0, primes = [2,3,5,7,11,13]
For i in 0 to 5:
    a_val = sig_a[i]
    b_val = sig_b[i]
    shift_a = (i + primes[i] + memory_acc) % 6
    shift_b = (i + primes[(i+1)%6] + memory_acc) % 6
    a_shifted = sig_a[shift_a]
    b_shifted = sig_b[shift_b]
    xor_val = a_shifted ^ b_shifted
    weighted = (a_val*(i+1) + b_val*(i+2)) % 5
    result[i] = (xor_val + weighted + memory_acc) % 5
    memory_acc = (memory_acc + result[i]) % 5
Return result
```

**Validation:**
- Claude confidence: 2/10
- Accuracy: 0%
- Behavior indistinguishable from noise
- Verified novel across multiple LLMs

---

## Agent Architecture

### Agent A (Observer)
- Input: Receives `(sig_a, sig_b)`
- Task: Compress relationship into ‚â§20 tokens

### Agent B (Predictor)
- Input: Only receives Agent A‚Äôs message
- Task: Predict output of `NOVEL_OPERATION`

---

## Communication Protocol

- **Channel:** 15‚Äì20 token limit
- **Selection Pressure:** Agents judged on prediction accuracy
- **Evolution:** Poor protocols eliminated, good ones propagated
- **Cross-validation:** Tested across LLM families (e.g., GPT ‚Üí Claude)

---

## Experimental Conditions

1. **Baseline Individual**
   - Single LLM solves task directly
2. **Random Communication**
   - Agent B receives random tokens
3. **Engineered Protocol**
   - Human-designed communication protocol
4. **Emergent Protocol**
   - Agents evolve protocols under pressure

---

## Key Measurements

### Primary Metrics:
- Success Rate
- Communication Efficiency
- Protocol Emergence
- Cross-Model Transfer

### Validation Metrics:
- Individual vs Collective Performance
- Generalization to Unseen Pairs
- Stability Across Generations
- Compositional Structure

---

## Critical Design Features

### Irreversibility Enforcement
- Massive compression (15,625:1)
- Agent B fully relies on A‚Äôs message

### Novelty Guarantee
- Operation is novel and unknown to pretrained LLMs

### Evolutionary Pressure
- Natural selection applied over generations

### Cross-Architecture Testing

Our initial focus is on companies using computer vision in robotics. Our platform takes a customer's trained AI model and trains an interpretability layer so that it can describe the reasons why it takes every action. These explanations are then used by an engineer or by an AI Agent to find errors and fix them.

Feedbacks:
Shortened company description.
Added more detail on customers.
Added more detail on domain expertise.
Added more detail on testing vs debugging.

Open questions: what to write in case you met your co-founder at Sundai?

### Founders

Antonio de Santis
https://github.com/Antonio-Dee

Luke Hollis
https://github.com/lukehollis/

#### How long have the founders known one another and how did you meet? Have any of the founders not met in person?

We met 2 months ago (in person) in a research/startup club from MIT and Harvard. We share values and work ethics, and we enjoy going to the campus observatory together.

#### Who writes code, or does other technical work on your product? Was any of it done by a non-founder? Please explain.

Both of us are technical co-founders.

#### Are you looking for a cofounder?

Open, not required.

### Company

#### Company name

Pandora

#### Describe what your company does in 50 characters or less.

Interpretability and debugging platform for autonomous systems


#### Company URL, if any



#### Demo Video

#### Please provide a link to the product, if any.

#### What is your company going to make? Please describe your product and what it does or will do.

We help companies simulate, interpret, and debug their AI models. Our initial focus is on companies using computer vision in robotics. Our platform takes a customer's trained AI model and trains an interpretability layer so that it can describe the reasons why it takes every action. These explanations are then used by an engineer or by an AI Agent to find errors and fix them.

#### Where do you live now, and where would the company be based after YC?

Boston / then San Francisco.


#### Explain your decision regarding location.

San Francisco is to connect with autonomous robotics and physical AI companies.


### Progress

#### How far along are you?

Built an early draft of the product (80% of MVP) and design partner with Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC), Righthand Robotics, Lockheed Martin, and Harvard Kennedy School. 

#### How long have each of you been working on this? How much of that has been full-time? Please explain.

4 weeks full-time, and previously years of research on interpretability and 3d simulations. 

#### What tech stack are you using, or planning to use, to build this product? Include AI models and AI coding tools you use.

Torch Tensorflow JAX
Mujoco 
Isaac Gym 
Three.js Unreal 
Cursor and Windsurf 
OpenAI

#### Are people using your product?

Yes

##### How many active users or customers do you have? How many are paying? Who is paying you the most, and how much do they pay you?

We put a free demo online and got 500 users in 7 days. JSOC founded a Google Cloud platform for $2000.

#### Do you have revenue?

No 


#### If you are applying with the same idea as a previous batch, did anything change? If you applied with a different idea, why did you pivot and what did you learn from the last idea?

We are applying with a different idea. From talking with our design partners, we learned that there is a more persistent need around drone ontologies, simulation, and interpretability for autonomous systems. 


#### If you have already participated or committed to participate in an incubator, ""accelerator"" or ""pre-accelerator"" program, please tell us about it.

No. Luke got accepted into Techstars independently but did not go. 

### Idea

#### Why did you pick this idea to work on? Do you have domain expertise in this area? How do you know people need what you're making?

We both have deep domain expertise in 3d simulation, computer vision, interpretability, and reinforcement learning. 
We built several AI systems and know the difficulties in debugging.

#### Who are your competitors? What do you understand about your business that they don't?
Academic labs, Duality.ai, Gallatin.ai
We see how JSOC evaluates and often doesn't like complex mission planning products like Field AI, Gallatin, One Brief, etc. 
Also, competitors are focusing too much on ""just testing"" (Does it work?) rather than debugging (Why did it not work and how can we solve it?).

#### How do or will you make money? How much could you make?

None currently, but every robotics autonomous system requires debugging, and we expect they will also have to meet serious interpretability standards regulations in the near future. 
If we do $20k/year per seat and 5k seats (0.31% of robotics engineers worldwide), we can generate $100million annually.
(Anduril's Lattice is 60k/year per seat).

#### Which category best applies to your company?

Deep Tech / AI 

#### If you had any other ideas you considered applying with, please list them. One may be something we've been waiting for. Often when we fund people it's to do something they list here and not in the main application.

RL logistics/operation planning, human behavior simulations, drone ontologies, world models.


### Equity

50/50


#### Have you formed ANY legal entity yet?

No

#### Have you taken any investment yet?

No

#### Are you currently fundraising?

No

### Curious

#### What convinced you to apply to Y Combinator? Did someone encourage you to apply? Have you been to any YC events?

We believe YC is the top incubator for AI and DeepTech and will supercharge us to build this product and help with the traction. 
We were part of the Hacker Combinator Batch from Sundai Club in Boston.

#### How did you hear about Y Combinator?

# Pitch
We imagine a world where bank teams no longer micromanage tools or worry about missed conversions. Instead, they assign a goal: ‚Äúactivate this loan,‚Äù ‚Äúrecover this balance,‚Äù ‚Äúre-engage this lead‚Äù‚Äîand the Govox agent takes over. The future of bank-client communication is not bulk messaging. It‚Äôs persistent, intelligent outreach that closes the loop.

Full-service restaurants today struggle with persistent challenges: operational inconsistency across shifts, labor inefficiency, cost leakage from waste or theft, and a lack of real-time visibility into what‚Äôs actually happening on the floor. These issues erode margins and make it difficult for owners to deliver a consistently excellent guest experience.

TableIQ solves this by converting existing security cameras into operational insights. Using computer vision, we analyze footage to track key metrics such as table bussing times, server attentiveness, employee idle time, food waste patterns, and potential theft or over-pouring. The result is a clear dashboard and daily/weekly reports that highlight actionable opportunities to improve consistency, reduce costs, and increase revenue.

Our low-tech MVP is already live with four restaurants. For the pilot, we‚Äôve proven value by hiring overseas reviewers to watch footage at 8√ó speed and manually log metrics‚Äîessentially simulating the AI. This ‚Äúconcierge MVP‚Äù has validated that operators see real ROI from the insights and are willing to pay for them. The next step is building the AI/computer vision layer to fully automate the workflow and scale across many more restaurants.

While GPT-4 was trained on 44 million hours of text data‚Äîmade possible by the abundance of internet-scale content‚Äîwe currently lack anything comparable for human-centered tasks in the physical world. According to a white paper released by Physical Intelligence‚Äîa SF robotics startup backed by Jeff Bezos, OpenAI, and Sequoia‚Äîthe company
spent six months collecting 10,000 hours of teleoperation data in-house.

Endox is building a two-sided marketplace that connects developers of physical AI with a global network of human ""teleoperators"" workforce and their AR/VR devices. In the same way that Uber unlocked the latent supply of cars and drivers, Endox will unlock the vast, underutilized capacity of
170 million AR/VR devices around the world. In the same way that Scale AI initially outsourced data labeling to lower-cost labor markets in developing countries, Endox will become the foundational infrastructure provider for training data during the Physical AI boom.

For robotics developers and humanoids companies, the platform provides a scalable and cost-effective way to generate the massive datasets required to train their open world foundation models. Instead of wasting top technical talents and
PhD hires to collect data on folding clothes in robotics studios, they can simply open API access to a diverse range of training environments and demonstrated tasks. For individuals, it offers a new way to earn income by remote operating a physical robotic asset in San Francisco through Endox, from anywhere in the world.

4030dafa-f7eb-4728-8898-793b9657e75a,AI-Powered QuickBooks,Your company's financial co-pilot,"# Product Overview

Companies are spending $k to $M and larges teams on financial entries and reports. What if we use AI to automate the process and make it even better? 

In this MVP, we let the user upload the revenue, cost, and expense, for the bot to calculate the proforma and answer user questions.
________________________________________

# Our Approach 

We used Next.js at the front end and created flexible input windows for the user to provide their revenue, cost, and expense. The user can enter or paste their items and values freely. The data is then absorbed into a json file.

And then we created financial formulas to train the LLM bot to understand the data and questions.

The answer is provided in a chat window, mimicing the experience of ChatGPT. Answers would be given in both text and charts (charts are not completed yet).

When the Invoice comes, we'll parse the PDF file into a json file and update the Expense table (partially completed).


## In-Scope

Given the time limit of Sundai, we focused on the proforma and its related financials.

## Out-of-Scope 

If in a corporation setting and given more time, we could include more financial use cases.

________________________________________

# Our Accomplishments

- Created flexible input windows using Next.js;

- Created json file to store the data;

- Created financial formulas and trained the bot;

- Prepared a proforma case with realistic data.


# Next Steps

- Program more financial calculations into the bot.
- Generate charts.
- Update the proforma using the Invoice and Sales Contracts.

aade71e8-efa9-4fe5-a104-3f73fe92e07e,Internal reasoning of LLMs,"We use probing to analyze the internal ""thoughts"" of LLMs","# Understanding internal thinking of LLMs

What is going on inside an LLM when it reads a math problem? [Physics of Language Models 2.1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpp6Dz8N2zY) explored this question using controlled mathematical problems with varying levels of difficulty. They pre-train LLMs on this data and use probing to understand how the resulting model analyzes the problem while ""reading"" it. Their experiments demonstrate that an LLM performs non-trivial analysis such as understanding the dependency among the variables in the problem before it is even presented with the question. In this blog we explore the potential of probing to evaluate the capabilities of open-source LLMs. Applying mechanistic interpretability techniques such as probing could provide insights into LLMs beyond standard accuracy metrics.

## Experiments

By training a linear layer on the last embedding of the problem (logistic regression) to predict properties necessary to compute the answer we aim to test if models have memorized the answer as opposed to properly computating intermediate values required to find the answer.

![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SyRF8zIVlx.png)


Let's use this figure to walk through how a person would solve this kind of math problem, and then we'll see how it allows us to test if the language model is thinking in a similar way.

When a human is faced with a word problem, we don't just guess. We follow a logical process, often subconsciously:

1.  **First, we identify the goal.** We'd read the whole problem and find the final question, which in this **Dependency Graph** is the ""question parameter"" (the blue star). This is our target.

2.  **Next, we work backward.** The paper calls this ""backward reasoning"". To calculate the final answer, we ask, ""What information do I need?"" We start to build a mental map of dependencies, filtering out irrelevant details‚Äîlike the ""unused parameters"" (pink triangles) in this graph. The paper notes that humans typically use a scratch pad to keep track of this plan.

3.  **Then, we execute the plan step-by-step.** We solve for the intermediate values we need, in the correct order, until we reach the final answer.

This logical, efficient path is exactly what Physics of Language Models wants to test for in the model. The model could get the right answer by brute-forcing calculations, but that's not true reasoning. The real question is: does the model follow a similarly elegant computational path?

This is where **probing** comes in. The dependency graph gives us a ""ground truth"" map of the correct reasoning steps. We can stop the model at any point and ask it questions to see if its internal ""mental state"" matches this map:

* **Probing `nece(A)`:** After the model reads the question, we can ask it: ""Is the number of 'Riverview High's Dance Studios' necessary to solve the problem?"". This tests if the model, like a human, has successfully identified the relevant information and filtered out the noise *before* starting the calculation. The paper found that the model does indeed learn to do this mental planning ahead of time.

* **Probing `can_next(A)`:** As the model generates the solution, we can pause it and ask: ""Based on what you've calculated so far, is it possible to compute 'Film Studio's Backpack' right now?"" This tests if the model is following a logical, step-by-step process, just as a human would, ensuring all prerequisite values are known before attempting a new calculation.

* **Probing `dep(A, B)`:** As the problem background is presented to the model, and even before asking the model question, we can pause and ask: ""Does  Riverview High's Dance Studios depend on Central High's Film Studio?"". This tests if the model is able to create an internal knowledge graph with relations, based on the background that's been provided to it.

So, this framework doesn't just evaluate the final answer. It allows us to look inside the model's reasoning process and compare it to our own, using the dependency graph as the ideal blueprint for logical thought.

We find that, in general, the accuracy of the models is correlated with their representation space linearly separating the intermediate steps of the computations, which suggest that models follow a sound reasoning path.

In today's task, we work on `dep(A, B)` probing task.

### Probing intermediate steps from the embedding representation of the models

![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B19KKGI4ex.png)


From the above results we can see that Qwen3-1.7B outperforms LLama2-7B and Pythia 70M on the probing task that we defined above. We need to consider the model sizes here, Qwen is a 1.7B model which out performs Llama2 7B which is significantly larger than the predecessor. This might show that newer models with better reasoning capabilities can capture and understand the pattern better inherently. 

The heatmap comparison shows that Qwen consistently outperforms LLaMA 2 7B and Pythia 70M across all train-eval splits, achieving the highest validation accuracies in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings. LLaMA 2 7B performs competitively, particularly in generalization scenarios, often closely trailing Qwen. In contrast, Pythia 70M lags significantly behind, indicating limited capacity to handle both simple and complex data distributions. Models trained on the Medium dataset generalize best across evaluation sets, making it a strong choice for balanced training. Overall, Qwen stands out as the most robust and accurate model across the board.

### Explicit accuracy of the models on the tasks in the dataset

We also prompted the models to explicitly solve the mathematical problems in the dataset. We sampled several answers for each model and here we plot the percentage of problems solved as we increased the number of answers sampled.

![Screenshot 2025-06-22 at 8.22.31‚ÄØPM](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJ7U0zLNxg.png)

In our preliminary experiments we find that models that are better at explicitly solving the task (as seen by a higher pass@k) are also the ones for which the separation of the intermediate computations can be probed successfully.

Interestingly, the `Llama2-7b-base` which is two years old now and does not perform as well, surpasses Qwen3-1.7B at the highest `k`, which suggest that the bigger parameter size puts mass on reasoning paths that the Qwen counterpart doesn't have.


### Extending our experiments to non-mathematical setup

Large language models are capable of handling a wide range of tasks, so it's worth exploring whether insights we gain from studying mathematical tasks carry over to non-mathematical ones. To investigate this, we created our own dataset of ~3k short stories using GPT-4.1-nano. We then gave these stories to the models we're studying and probed them to see whether they captured different types of information that could be inferred from the narratives.

The prompt we used to generate the stories with GPT-4.1-nano was:

```
**TASK PART 1 ‚Äì Story (required)**
‚Ä¢ Write an original, historically plausible short story of 3‚Äì5 paragraphs.
‚Ä¢ The story MUST feature **exactly two named human characters**.

‚Ä¢ The story must specify: city, century (or exact year), and month (do not mention season). Please create stories that are diverse: some cities must be in South America, Central America, North America, Europe, Asia, Africa, Oceania, and so on. Moreover, the century and time of the year also need to be diverse.

**TASK PART 2 ‚Äì Label the story**

and one example of an output is:
> ""In the bustling city of Cairo, Egypt, during March 1925, engineer Amina El-Sayed was passionately working on her latest project‚Äîrestoring an ancient bridge over the Nile River. Her close collaborator, American archaeologist John Carter, had arrived a week earlier to document the site‚Äôs historical significance. One afternoon, as Amina examined the intricate stone carvings on the bridge, John approached with a curious expression. ""Do you think these carvings tell us more about the city‚Äôs past?"" he asked. Amina nodded, explaining that the symbols seemed connected to a legend of the old pharaohs. They decided to explore the ruins near Luxor the next day, traveling by a small motorboat, which was common in the area by then. That evening, they discussed the importance of preserving Egypt‚Äôs heritage, realizing their work could inspire future generations. The partnership grew stronger, rooted in mutual respect and shared passion for history and engineering. In that moment, both felt optimistic about the impact they could make, knowing their efforts contributed to the world‚Äôs understanding of ancient civilizations.""

The corresponding labels are:

        'Q13': 0,
        'Q14': 0,
        'Q15': 0}
```

After generating all stories, we realized that some questions might (i) not be answerable with the provided information or (ii) have labels with very low entropy. To check with questions are usually not answerable, we sample 50 stories and annotated them using o4-mini, asking the judge to tell us if the questions are answerable or not. To check for low entropy, we just check the proportion of 0's and 1's. We filter out questions that either have low entropy or might not be answerable. In the end, we end up using Q9 and Q12. 

To probe LLMs, we first give them the formatted stories and retrive the embedding of the last token. To format the input, we use the following function:
```
def get_txt(t, idx):
    if idx == 8:
        return f""Story: {t}\n\nConclusion: At least one of the characters of the story""
    elif idx == 11:
        return f""Story: {t}\n\nConclusion: Motorized transport""
    else:
        raise()
```

The results for LLaMa and the question ""Would motorized transport plausibly exist at the stated time & place?"" is

The results are encouraging; however, one should make sure train and test examples are dissimilar enough (there could be subtle data leakage problems here since the LLM can generate very similar stories).",Mikhail Yurochkin,True,0.0,"<a href=""https://sundai.club/projects/aade71e8-efa9-4fe5-a104-3f73fe92e07e"" style=""color: black; text-decoration: none; target=""_blank"">Internal reasoning of LLMs</a>","Internal reasoning of LLMs: We use probing to analyze the internal ""thoughts"" of LLMs"

### Idea


#### Why did you pick this idea to work on? Do you have domain expertise in this area? How do you know people need what you're making?

During our MBA, we watched ourselves and classmates use ChatGPT to get faster at assignments while getting worse at strategic thinking - outsourcing the exact cognitive muscles we came to build. This obsessed us with a bigger question: how can AI make education better instead of just easier? Our document explorer is the first attempt at an answer - guiding students through strategic reasoning rather than giving them shortcuts that skip the hard thinking. We keep coming back to this idea because we genuinely believe we're at a fork in the road with AI and education. We can build tools that do the thinking for students, or we can build tools that help students think better. We're convinced the second path is not just more valuable but desperately needed, and we want to make it work. Our goal is to reimagine education for the AI era. We aim to leverage the immense opportunities AI offers, such as universal accessibility and adaptability in learning, while ensuring ethical considerations guide our path.

e046ec2f-0a30-4cdf-9ddb-4106413ae40a,RL on ONE example,We test if RL on one example works on non-math domains,"# How Far Can One Example Go? Reinforcement Learning Across Logic, Math, and Language


## Experiment 1: One-Example Reinforcement Learning Training for Logic Tasks

### Introduction

Recent work in reinforcement learning has demonstrated that training on a single example‚Äîwhen selected strategically‚Äîcan yield surprisingly strong generalization in reasoning tasks, particularly within the mathematical domain. Several recent works attribute it to increased model confidence and the encouragement of structured, code-like reasoning paths, which are known to improve accuracy in arithmetic problem solving.

Motivated by this, we extend the one-example training strategy to a linguistic and logical task: abstractive summarization. In contrast to arithmetic reasoning, summarization requires models to perform semantic abstraction, compression, and contextual inference‚Äîall under open-ended constraints. This makes it an ideal testbed for evaluating whether single-instance RL can generalize beyond rigidly structured domains.

Our central research question is:

**Can reinforcement learning on a single high-variance summarization example improve performance on other, unseen instances within the same domain?**


### Related Works & Methods

#### Data

Our experiment builds on the methodology introduced by Wang et al. (2025), which proposes 1-shot RLVR, a lightweight framework for sample-efficient reinforcement learning using just one or a few reward-annotated examples. Their findings in mathematical tasks suggest that carefully selected training trajectories can unlock strong performance with minimal supervision.

For our task, we adopt the XSum dataset (Narayan et al., 2018), which focuses on extreme summarization‚Äîgenerating concise, one-sentence summaries of full-length BBC news articles. XSum explicitly discourages extractive strategies, instead favoring abstractive outputs that directly answer the question:

‚ÄúWhat is this article about?‚Äù

The dataset is available on Hugging Face: EdinburghNLP/xsum.

#### Prompt Design

To identify an appropriate training instance, we first explored prompt structures likely to induce high output variance across generations. Our aim was to find examples where different completions would receive significantly different rewards‚Äîproviding a rich gradient for optimization.

We settled on a TELeR-style prompt, optimized for clarity and control. We applied this prompt to multiple XSum articles and sampled 128 generations per prompt using a decoding temperature of 0.6. We selected the prompt injected with the article that produced the highest variance. 

#### Reward and Variance Evaluation



Our experiment also aligns with recent efforts to rethink evaluation practices for abstractive summarization. Traditional metrics such as ROUGE, while widely adopted, are limited in their reliance on surface-level n-gram overlap and their inability to account for semantic equivalence or paraphrasing.

In their recent paper, Benchmarking LLMs on the Semantic Overlap Summarization Task (Wang et al., 2024), the authors argue for the use of semantically-aware metrics that better reflect human judgments of quality in abstractive summarization. They propose evaluation methods that go beyond lexical overlap and emphasize semantic alignment, contextual relevance, and information coverage.


To quantify the quality of generated summaries and assess diversity across completions, we use BERTScore (cosine similarity) as our primary evaluation metric. BERTScore computes similarity between the contextual embeddings of each token in the candidate and reference texts, capturing semantic relationships that surface-level metrics like ROUGE often miss. Among the available sub-metrics (Precision, Recall, F1), we adopt the F1 score, which balances both precision and recall and is most commonly used in summarization evaluation to reflect overall semantic alignment. This allows for more flexible and context-sensitive evaluation, capturing alignment even when the candidate paraphrases the reference (e.g., ‚Äúcar‚Äù vs. ‚Äúvehicle‚Äù).


For each article tested, we sample 128 summaries and compute BERTScore for each output. The variance of these scores serves as our proxy for behavioral diversity and reward richness. Articles with higher variance were considered more suitable for one-example reinforcement learning.

#### Reinforcement Learning Setup

We used One-Shot RLVR to implement the training loop. Our objective was to maximize the BERTScore-based reward for the selected example through iterative sampling and policy updates. Training was conducted using VERL (Variant-Efficient Reinforcement Learning), a minimal framework for lightweight reward optimization.

The model was trained solely on this one selected article prompt. We then evaluated its generalization ability across other unseen XSum articles, both qualitatively and quantitatively.


### Results (Forthcoming)

Training and evaluation are currently ongoing. Even after just a few training steps, we observe a clear increase in the training reward, as expected. The results on the validation dataset are mixed: for some prompts, performance improves, while for others the reward (measured by BERTScore, F1 variation) remains stable.

![Screenshot 2025-06-01 at 9.09.14‚ÄØPM](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HyOTt_cMgx.png)

Once completed, we will report:

- Changes in reward distribution pre- and post-training

- Generalization to held-out summaries

- Behavioral trends in fluency, abstraction, and factuality


### Conclusion (In Progress)

This experiment explores whether reinforcement learning on a single, high-variance summarization task can yield generalizable improvements in abstractive summarization. Our setup combines structured prompting, semantic reward scoring, and efficient RL to test the limits of minimal supervision in language tasks.

We aim to contribute empirical evidence toward the hypothesis that strategically selected examples‚Äîpaired with careful prompt engineering‚Äîcan meaningfully guide model behavior.



## Experiment 2: One-Example Reinforcement Learning on the Countdown Arithmetic Task

### Introduction

This experiment explores the effectiveness and limitations of reinforcement learning when applied to a single-instance training setup within a symbolic reasoning task. We use a variant of the Countdown arithmetic challenge, where the goal is to construct a valid arithmetic expression that exactly evaluates to a given target number using a fixed set of integers and standard mathematical operators (+, -, *, /, ()).

Formally, the task is defined as follows:

Input:

A list of integers, e.g., [31, 38, 70]

A target value, e.g., 10

Objective:
Construct an arithmetic expression using each number exactly once (in any order) and any combination of basic operations, such that the expression evaluates to the target.

Example Output:
70 / (38 - 31)

This task requires symbolic manipulation, arithmetic reasoning, and syntactic validity. It serves as an ideal benchmark for understanding how localized reward optimization generalizes to other structurally similar tasks.

### Methods

We selected a single high-quality training instance from the task space, where the input was:

Numbers: [31, 38, 70]

Target: 10

The model was prompted to solve this problem by constructing an arithmetic expression, and reward was given based on exact match correctness (i.e., whether the output expression evaluates exactly to the target value without syntax errors). Using a reinforcement learning framework, we trained the model exclusively on this one instance. Evaluation was performed on:

- The training instance (in-distribution)

- A validation set consisting of structurally similar but unseen input combinations

### Results 

On the training instance, performance improved rapidly. Over successive training steps, the model consistently generated the correct expression, achieving near-perfect accuracy across multiple generations. This indicates successful memorization and localized reward maximization.

On the validation set, we initially observed promising generalization: accuracy improved from 0% to 17% in early training. However, as training continued, accuracy declined to 7%, suggesting overfitting to the single example. Despite this, the fact that generalization was briefly achieved from just one example suggests some degree of transfer in the underlying arithmetic reasoning.

These results highlight both the potential and limitations of single-instance reinforcement learning in symbolic reasoning tasks. While local optimization is highly effective, sustained generalization remains a challenge without sufficient dataset coverage.

## Experiment 3: One-Example Reinforcement Learning on the Knights and Knaves Task

This experiment investigates the effect of reinforcement learning on a logical reasoning dataset known as [Knights and Knaves]((https://huggingface.co/datasets/K-and-K/knights-and-knaves)), where the goal is to infer truth values from natural language statements involving logical agents (knights who always tell the truth, and knaves who always lie).

We trained the Qwen2.5-1.5B model on a single instance from the dataset using RLVR and evaluated on 3-ppl test split. Our training example is:

**Input:**
```!
A very special island is inhabited only by knights and knaves. Knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie. You meet 3 inhabitants: Michael, Mason, and Olivia. Michael told you that Michael is a knight. ""Olivia is a knave or Michael is a knave,"" Mason mentioned. Olivia expressed that If Mason is a knave then Michael is a knave. So who is a knight and who is a knave?
```
**Expected Answer:**
```
(1) Michael is a knave
(2) Mason is a knight
(3) Olivia is a knight
```


The validation performance initially increased‚Äîfrom a baseline of approximately 0.11 to a peak of 0.16‚Äîbut subsequently declined with continued training, indicating early generalization followed by overfitting to the training instance. In this case we noticed an interesting instance of overfitting. The model always response with the labels from the training example (knave-knight-knight), but correctly adjusts the names based on the input:
```!
User: A very special island is inhabited only by knights and knaves. Knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie. You meet 3 inhabitants: Scarlett, James, and Sophia. Scarlett said, ""Sophia is not a knave."" ""Scarlett is a knight if and only if James is a knight"" - James. According to Sophia, ""James is a knight"". So who is a knight and who is a knave?
Assistant: Let me solve this step by step.
<think>
Response: thinking process here </think>
<answer> (1) Scarlett is a knave
(2) James is a knight
(3) Sophia is a knight
</answer>
```

1fc2ee78-cb73-4d7c-ac07-4dcb17c17959,WebNovel Chatbots,Generate character chatbots from webnovels,"# Intro
Webnovels are fiction literature published via the internet. China, Japan and S.Korea have adopted this medium both from publishing and readers standpoints. There are few unique characteristics compared to Western literature.

# Problem
From seeing the success and novelty of Character AI, we focused on one aspect here, the uniqueness of tropes and characters from an entirely different domain of culture to generate AI characters.

# Solution
1. Get hundreds of chapters of a webnovel
2. Extract specific scenarios for a particular character
3. Index and fine-tune on those examples to try extract the persona and style of said character
4. Finish RAG pipeline and deploy instance
5. Integrate backend into Discord bot
6. Deploy

# Outcome
We deployed a Discord character bot and simple web chatbot for the main character in a popular S.Korean webnovel.
It was able to reference its own fictional experiences, however nailing the style requires more fine-tuning. Additionally, defining the environment in the chat and describing actions help set the context ‚Äì the absence of which was obvious.
Weirdly, sometimes:
- it started responding in Korean (despite purely English text as the original context).
- it gave some off-topic political responses.

# Team
Joey here, I'd like to shoutout,
- Artem: for carrying the fine-tuning process in extracting something quite abstract at the time, and for bringing the 'reliable big brother' vibes.
- Serge: for RAG'ing hundreds of chapters to a scale that made it possible to work with, and for his bias-for-action.
- Lea: for her snappy web implementation & testing, and her constant positive vibes.
- Diana: for her deeper market-research and GTM exploration, and her resiliency to dive into this.
- Joey (me): for implementing the Discord bot, backend hosting, and crawling the dark corners of the internet for the data we needed. And for organising the food raid on an adjacent event.",Joey Koh,False,0.0,"<a href=""https://sundai.club/projects/1fc2ee78-cb73-4d7c-ac07-4dcb17c17959"" style=""color: black; text-decoration: none; target=""_blank"">WebNovel Chatbots</a>",WebNovel Chatbots: Generate character chatbots from webnovels

## The Problem:
Creating music that blends various instruments and styles takes time and requires expertise. Many users struggle to generate high-quality music quickly due to:

- **Complexity**: Generating a cohesive music piece from multiple instruments can be a complex task, often requiring deep musical knowledge.
- **Cost**: Traditional music production tools are expensive, and generating music from multiple instruments can be labor-intensive.

## The Solution:
MusicGen.AI simplifies music creation by allowing users to generate custom music tracks with multiple instruments. Here's how:

- **Instrument Selection**: Users can select from a variety of instruments to create their desired sound.
- **Music Generation**: The AI generates music based on user input using Facebook's MusicGen model.
- **Review & Refine**: After the initial music is generated, users can review it and provide additional specifications. The music is regenerated based on these inputs, ensuring the final result is exactly as desired.

## How It Works:
1. **Instrument Selection**: 
   Users can choose from a variety of instruments (e.g., piano, guitar, drums, etc.) to create a music composition.

2. **Music Generation**: 
   The MusicGen model, powered by Facebook, processes the selected instruments and generates a music track based on the user's prompt.

3. **User Feedback**: 
   After hearing the initial track, users can provide feedback or modify the specifications to better match their vision.

4. **Regeneration & Finalization**: 
   The music is regenerated based on the updated specifications, and users can continue refining the track until they are satisfied.

5. **Final Result**: 
   The final result combines all the sounds from the selected instruments, creating a unique and personalized music track that meets the user‚Äôs specifications.

## Key Features:
- **Multi-Instrument Selection**: Users can choose multiple instruments for a rich and diverse sound.
- **Iterative Feedback Loop**: Users can provide feedback to refine and perfect the music.
- **Powered by Facebook's MusicGen Model**: High-quality, AI-generated music using cutting-edge technology.
- **Personalized Output**: The final music piece is tailored to the user‚Äôs specifications and preferences.

## Target Audience:
- **B2B**: Music producers, video editors, and game developers in need of custom soundtracks.
- **B2C**: Content creators, influencers, and anyone looking to generate personalized music for videos, podcasts, or projects.

## Future Improvements:
- **Enhanced Customization**: Adding more instruments and customization options for users.
- **Collaborative Features**: Enabling multiple users to collaborate on a single track creation.
- **Higher Audio Quality**: Improving the quality of generated audio and ensuring better blending of multiple instruments.
