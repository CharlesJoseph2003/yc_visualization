**Problem**: There are many hacks on Sundai Club website. It's hard to discover cool things just by scrolling down or searching by a tag. Many cool older hacks are buried, and they have to be manually highlighted in the main page. There is little incentive for hackers to have a tidy description of their hacks. It's hard to close the loop and incentivize the hacks to be regularly used.

**Solution**: Create a visual overview of Sundai Club projects. Allow exploration of hacks. Be able to click through to the project.

**How it Works**: Ingest data from Sundai Club database, create a clickable structure, offer compelling interaction:
 - View the tags
 - View the clusters

**Marketing**: Copy about the goal of the project, which will be shared.
